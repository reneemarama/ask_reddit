0,how do you deal with erectile dysfunction and performance anxiety  this  is something i    m  really need to get off my chest  i m curious if  others have this problem and how they deal with it  this is going to be a  bit of a long story  i really hope you ll read  i desperately need some  advice and consoling   i ve had  issues regarding performance anxiety resulting to ed my entire life only  the last month it has gotten significantly worse  before it was just  the first one or two times with a new girl and after that it was pretty  much smooth sailing with the exception here and there but nothing  serious   since a week or   i m  dating someone     f  and having sex is kind of a hit or miss situation   i either can t get it up at all or it s goes til        but starts  dropping during penetrative sex gradually  i blame that mostly to  desensitizing of my penis that happens over time during sex  that always  happens but before it didn t lead to loosing my erection  when i can t  get erect we just continue with mouth  and hand stuff  i go down on her  and finger her until she climaxes  so no rushing or doing it just out of  guilt or to get it over with  i want to pleasure her  for her there is  not much to do to me since i m flacid  afterwards we just chill  cuddle  and talk  i usually already lost my sexual arroussal and don t feel the  need to climax myself  no blue balls or anything of the sorts   as  i wrote above  before this girl it happened sometimes  usually the  first time  now there are some things i think are important that i d  like to point out      i have been  friends with this girl for a few years without anything  romantically sexually happening  there was some tension but that didn t  release until   weeks ago      my  life was sexless for the past    months  before that i had sex a few  times over a two week period with a tinder hookup  before that it was  also awfully quiet for a year       i m not necessarily sexually attracted to her in a physical way  face as  well as body  note  i m not turned off by her  this probably plays a  big part but i have been with women that way before and it never lead to  any issues that were so consistent  usually before we get started i am  turned on by her and she arouses me  my penis just thinks otherwise       a few times we tried and it failed we were on drugs like amphetamine  and xtc  these obviously are very counter productive but one of the   best  times  where everything worked  was after an entire night and day  of partying on said substances  other times where it didn t work out we  were just sober      this results  in performance anxiety  i start to get worried beforehand  sometimes i m  horny before i meet her and when i see her or when we start it just  disappears      i stopped  masturbating and stopped watching porn  i watched porn maybe once a week  and it could be between    minutes up to an hour  i haven t done that  in   weeks  i am aware that it plays a part since you link sex to  images  your own hand and having full control of what you want to see  etc  you loose sight of how sex feels and forget that actually having  sex is very different from porn   what  all this results in is is that when i do manage to get erect i try to  make the best of it since i m afraid of loosing it so we just stay in  one position and i often come quite fast  the entire session then lasts  somewhere between       minutes depending on foreplay where penetration  makes up for maybe   minutes  theres nothing wrong with one position  and quick but i usually chose to do that  no im afraid to switch  positions or whatever because ill probably loose my erection in the  process   i noticed that i have to  train myself to focus on feeling again instead of what i see  what i  want  or fantasize about  when i do that and get into that zone it  starts getting erect but often i get distracted  this happens very  easily  and i loose it again  this does lead me to believe that its  more between my ears than it is physical   two  days ago she came over and beforehand i was horny throughout the day   once we got started i didnt get erect  she sucked my dick for a while  but still nothing  then i went down on her and afterwards i kind of  climbed on top of her  shes lying on her back  and she sucked me some  more  now this is a position that im really turned on by  i had to give  it some time but surely but slowly i got erect and we continued to have  penetrative sex albeit in   position   i  really like her tho  whenever we get together we immediately get into a  zone and we can just chill for an entire weekend only rotating between  bed  couch and shower just listening to music and talking to eachother   we even talk openly about this issue  she says it s not really a problem  for her but i know that s not entirely the case  i know she enjoys  penetrative sex and so do i  i really feel like that part is something  that is missing  i also want to share that with her and satisfy her and  myself   i hope this is something  that will pass over time and i can train myself to be more comfortable  and get out of my head and into the moment  i believe that is what it  boils down to and is an issue that i struggle with in daily life as  well  getting into the moment   thanks for your patience  i hope you can share some insights  tip and personal experiences  ,0.957,1024

0,straight guys  are you fully aware of how incredibly picky women generally are when it comes to selecting male partners  its a typical work day and im on my lunch break with a couple of my female colleagues  im a young  funny and friendly gay guy so of course girls and i are naturally drawn to friendships with each other  i know what girls are like and what theyre into and most importantly  how they operate  ive been at the canteen table many times when one of the single girls pulls out her phone and starts swiping on tinder and showing us her  potential matches  she has to choose from on the app  most days we will slip into a routine where we will pass the phone around to each other and im always astounded at how most of the girls will swipe left on about     of the guys  swiping right on guys that are athletic  good looking with good skin and nice hair  they do so without even reading the profile  guys that look objectively athletic  handsome and attractive  theyre just swiping left on a good portion of them and when i exclaim   why are you not even entertaining the majority of these guys  most of these look really decent and well put together    but they cant really answer my question  it does appear that girls have a far higher reach than men when it comes to what they find attractive  and im not even talking about after theyve decided to read the profile or even get the gist of a guys personality  theyre often not interested in guys  even a good portion of the good looking ones  theyll even admit  he looks quite nice  but still  theyre not stimulated   when i get the phone im swiping right on most of the guys i find attractive which is a bulk of them  also im trying to help at least one brother out  but when the girls have the phone they are incredibly selective  i see on here a lot of guys struggling to find dates or appropriate relationships with women and i cant help noticing from the outside that the dating expectations between males and females are drastically asymmetrical  of course we cant pin all of mens dating failures on female pickiness  a fair portion of you are going to be guys who dont have their sh t together and probably just arent going to attract a suitable female   or you are just unattractive   and of course not all women are this picky    but i felt compelled to ask this question because it completely astounds me how guys i would be perfectly happy to go on a date with purely based on attraction and looks most girls wont even entertain a conversation with  so i was wondering if men were even aware of just how selective women truly were     side note  this is totally politically incorrect but im going for it  i was referring to my attractive female colleagues with ages varying from       in the above post  slim  pretty and conventionally attractive girls of varying personalities  races and ages  i have been at the table with my less attractive female colleagues  many of them overweight  unkempt and not particularly beautiful or charismatic and they also are quite picky  i dont know why they feel they can be so picky because in my opinion  most of the guys they swipe left on were way out of their leagues anyway  i dont see why an overweight    year old woman who smells a little bit of piss some days with two divorces under her ever expanding belt and three grown up kids who hate her feels that shes better than a load of good looking    year old guys but thats just me    ,0.9956,630

0,how can i gently persuade my partner to let go of material possessions  ive    m  have lived with my partner    f  for   years now  i love her to bits  but something ive noticed since day   is she owns alot of stuff  before i met her i had travelled and moved around alot  i basically have never really owned much of anything    anyway    years ago we bought our first house    bed   bath  we are the only people who live here  weve renovated it since we moved in and ive let her decorate the entire place  its got a really boho  lots of indoor plants  sit on the rug and drink exotic tea sorta vibe  it looks fantastic  i love what shes done with the place  but every closet in every room is full of stuff  which naturally leaks into the living spaces  every drawer  every cupboard is stacked full of stuff  it takes hours and hours to clean and organize because there is so much stuff  as a few examples  we have a closet full of painting equipment and blank canvases  like     canvases in there  we paint maybe once per year  theres a whole double closet full of fabrics  sewing machines  mannequins  and cosplay stuff ive never seen her use since we met  probably   giant storage bins full of dairies  journals  planners  blank books etc but none have ever been used  she has   that she uses daily and the rest just sit there  even stuff like bedding  we have    sets of sheets for our bed and   different quilt cover options  we only have   bed in the entire house  and probably    pairs of shoes  half of which have never been worn   ive never made an issue of it  financially were pretty secure so ive never policed how she spends her money  its her money  but in a practical sense we are running out of room in this house and i refuse to get a storage lockup  i feel a   bed house should be more than enough for   people    every   months or so i go through my stuff and either donate or bin anything i dont need  she will do the same  but her donate pile is just a few things she really doesnt want    how can i help her declutter her life  or atleast make suggestions about letting a few things go to make our day to day lives easier and more practical  i used to ride motorcycles  but i cant see myself buying one anytime in the next   years so i sold all my riding gear  and i think this might be a fundamental difference in how we think  she holds on to her cosplay stuff incase she wants to make another outfit one day  despite not making one in   years    another option ive considered is hiring a cleaner  which im not against if thats what the advice suggests but ive voiced this before and my partner didnt like the idea of someone else cleaning up our own mess and i kinda feel the same  i also dont think shes a hoarder  shes just a creative person who likes having her resources always available  even if they wont be used in the foreseeable future    any advice or ideas are appreciated  thanks ,0.9955,540

0,what do you expect from a woman when having sex  i    f  have been in a bunch of different relationships  but sleeping with someone new is always something difficult for me because i feel like a lot of pressure about  being good in bed     heres a little bit of context for my question but you dont have to read that  you can just answer the question in general    i am now coming to the end of a two year fight with vaginislus  which used to prevent me from having any penetrative sex  this has not stopped me from having a thrilling and inventive sex life with my partners  but i always feel like what i am doing is not as good as it should be  for example  i like giving head but i cant  and dont want to  deepthroat  or  whether it is a blowjob or handjob  even if the guy is enjoying himself i cant really tell if what hes feeling is kind of generic pleasure or something really good  and i know the easiest way to know is to ask but i find it also really un sexy to do a debriefing everything that happens in bed everytime  also i know i can now have sex with penetration but i also know it takes a lot of time for me to  let it in  because my muscle just need time to relax  and although i have been sexually active for     years now  penetration is new for me and i fear that im going to be  boring  to the next guy i have sex with because of all of that stuff     i know that is quite a problem about my own confidence as well  but with one of my ex boyfriends  i felt like we had a great  inventive and thrilling  sex life and he always said he had no problem with me having vaginismus  that is was okay  but when we broke up he told me about how frustrated and unhappy i made him because of that illness  so i dont know whats true anymore haha  ,0.9912,348

0,straight guys  what is the dating etiquette for informing a man about your period  okay this sounds oddly specific  but since it s a situation that me  f    and my girlfriends frequently have been in and  discussed  i thought this might be the place to get some answers    the situation is as follows  you re dating a guy in the casual way that seems so common nowadays meaning that you started by hooking up  now you re doing it frequently  it has not yet been established if you re headed towards more than sex  but sometimes you ll do other things like watch a movie  cook some food  get a drink at your place etc  sex always happens  but when you make plans  you do it to see each other and you always plan an activity  it s not a  hey wanna hook up   type of arrangement although you always end up in bed  maybe you hope it will lead to something more  so what do you do  when you have a date planned and you ll be on your period    is there some kind of etiquette to whether you need to  warn  the guy beforehand that it is that time of the month  so he knows sex might not happen or there ll be blood involved  my friends and i always feel awkward bringing it up on text and especially if you like them  you don t want to assume the sole purpose of the date is to hook up  we know not having sex is not the end of the world  but also don t want the guy to show up expecting it and be disappointed    since this keeps happening to us  maybe cause we bleed every month lol   it d be really nice to hear some male thoughts on what s the best way to handle this and if there s some sort of period informing social etiquette that we re missing out on  ,0.9769,327

0,are a lot of men as confused when it come to their first relationship or is he just a different case all together  my boyfriend of   years told me he doesn t think he ever loved me  broke up with me and then asked for me back  he then again said the same thing and broke up with me again   so i met this guy online   years ago and we instantly had this connection to each other  for my birthday present   years ago i went to england from ireland and saw him for the first time and it was the most magical time ever  we spent almost everyday playing games or talking online and saw each other in real life around once a month  we went everywhere together  our families loved each other and our moms were best friends  there really was no flaws in our relationship other then he would feel confused to what love was because i was his first girlfriend  and well first everything   we had the same group of friends  he called my mom  mama  like i do and constantly told me how he loved me more than anything and that i was his world   then he went to sri lanka with his family and came back and told me he wanted to break up randomly  although he felt this way i asked him to still come to ireland the next day as he planned to see if he really felt that was  which he agreed was a good idea  he came over and it again was perfect  he was happy as he normally was and told me he was  just being dumb and to forget about what happened   which i did  after leaving a few days later he told me he wanted to break up again so i agreed but he still couldn t resist messaging me  we played games and talked and he was so heart broken  i m quite confused how you can be heart broken if you don t love someone too    so a few days go by and he asks for me back and i believe he was the one for me so i said yes  he told me he would never do it again and that i m his forever  i went and saw him   times before new years and he was meant to come on the  nd of january  he called me the night before and told me he wasn t feeling well  saying his stomach hurt  which then led him to say he doesn t want to go to ireland tomorrow and then finally him saying he was upset  he didn t even have the guts to say it himself but instead made me play the guessing game  after he broke up with me i stayed on the phone with him for   hours talking about it all and then finally hung up  i also found out he didn t get me a christmas gift but asked me to buy him a     euro keyboard which he never took because it made him feel bad for not getting me anything  he didn t get me anything because he knew he was going to break up with me but waiting until the last minute until he did it  i was completely broken  my mom was as heart broken as i was  it was a feeling i never felt before and my mom said it felt like she lost a child     weeks later me and him talk on the phone for the first time since  and i tell him everything i was feeling and he did the same about his feelings   he told me   he wasn t happy anymore because he was always trying to make me happy but never told me what he wanted while we were dating    he said he missed me and i was his world and he wanted to get back together but he didn t want to put himself in that same boat as before    he kept bringing up things from our relationship that we both loved because it was just so peaceful    he also asked if i would ever stop messaging him scared he would loose me forever    he told me that he felt like he lost part of himself and that i wasn t just his best friend because i felt like more then that but he thought that would be the same if he stopped talking to a friend and when we finally went to bed we said goodnight like we used to but without the i love you     he also said that both families knowing was a lot of pressure for him because everyone was constantly asking how we were and if we were going to get married and stuff which made him uncomfortable because he s quite shy    that he fell asleep and woke up thinking about me    i told him   to date other people  because love and a connection like we had wasn t easy to find  it was just rare  he never would realize that without other experiences but he told me he didn t want to date anyone else because he knew it won t be just like a click like we had     that i ll always be there for him if he needed someone to talk to     tell he once he figured out how he felt     that our connection will never just disappear because it wasn t something we ever worked to have in the first place    we also booked a family vacation to america together in april which he won t be going to now and was planning a vacation to canary islands together over the summer  he also planned valentine s day get away and birthday one while i was already planning his  this is all now just wasted and aren t doing any of it    we were so special  nothing really will beat it  everyone who saw us were like  wow they are perfect for each other   we were opposites but also the same   we just vibed   he told me he wanted to stay friends and play games until he figured out how he felt but today he joined my call to tell me he didn t want to play with just me because it would make him uncomfortable  he just doesn t know what he wants    i don t know how he works  no one does  not even his mom  maybe other people are like him though  so what should i do next  wait  give up  it s really just fucking with my mental health too  i really need some help that isn t just  you deserve better  because he isn t a bad guy  he s just confused  ,0.9982,1125

0,how long does it take to last longer     hi all  would love some advice  ive been working on trying to last longer in bed  as sometimes i can go for a while and other times for barely a couple minutes and i want it to be more consistent and have more control over when i cum      i have been doing kegels for a couple of weeks now  and have also started masturbating at least once day and making myself last for at least    minutes via edging and stop start etc  used to masturbate only once or twice a week and then just went as quick as i could   i have also been doing this for a couple of weeks now     i have managed to last a little longer during sex since i started  but it still varies a lot  and when my partner gives me a handjob or blowjob i almost always finish in a couple minutes     so does anybody have any advice about how long it takes to get results from what im doing in terms of lasting longer  is there anything else i can do to help   would really love to be able to last longer during oral because it feels great and it would be nice to be able to just relax and enjoy it more without worrying how close im getting   im    btw  thanks all ,0.9897,229

0,i  m    want to ask out the daughter of a family friend  f     what is the best way of going about it  so here s the low down    i meet her at my cousins house at one of his pre wedding celebrations in november       she is his neighbour  we did have a conversation  and i thought she was cute but she had a boyfriend at the time  i saw her again a few days ago  at my aunts   th birthday  i knew she was single at the time and i was ready to ask her out  and we made eye contact a few times over the night  but my parents made me feel very awkward about it  the whole  cmon go talk to her  thing  which really put me off and it wasn t a great environment to do that sort of thing anyway  so the next day  i went to her place of work  checking tickets at the cinemas  and no ever actually checks them  so i knew she wouldn t be to busy  if i knew that it she would be busy i wouldn t have done it  but she wasn t there  today i tried driving to her house and just knock on the door  i up pulled right in front of her house and then chickened out  i honestly kinda think it was a bit of an achievement to even make it all that way  i am the sort of person that doesn t like taking risks and she is the first girl i ve made serious attempts on asking out  i was also worried that i would catch her off guard if i went to her home or make her feel uncomfortable in front of her parents  i m open to any questions  comments  advice  anything helpful ,0.9114,302

0,relationship changed me  i want to change back  advice please my girlfriend and i have been together for   years  first year everything was going smooth  after that we started living together and things seemed to drop down hard for me  i used to be this guy who enjoyed learning and exploring new ideas  learning new skills  being disciplined for stuff like working out and doing healthy habits  this all came  i think  from the fact that half the time that i was alone i was gaming and the other half my imagination ran wild with improving every day  since we started living together every night is the same thing  we get home at around       prepare dinner  breakfast   sit on our phones till       watch   episodes of some show   ive seen so many i cant count  its       we wash the dishes  take a shower each  go to bed  and then and only then maybe have sex  never before shower thought  cause that might be too adventurous somehow  always the same thing at the same time  ive tried talking to her about it  about watching way too much tv about me wanting to eat healthy   cause we always binge on some snacks  because she wants to eat     about wanting sex only when she has had her shower   now its like a chore because i get shut down at every opportunity that i try to do something   she has no motivation for anything other than cooking  cleaning  washing and going to the market to buy the stuff for those said things  no hobbies  nothing   watching facebook and instagram is not a hobby    i want to say no to all those things but when i do  i feel bad because i truly love her but i dont want to go down that rabbit hole of laziness and i am deep in it already as it is  every attempt to make things better is temporary because if i try to do something on my own she just takes it as a sign that i dont love her anymore or something similar like being silent and annoyed and we start to fight  basically she has no drive and instead of her getting motivated by my ambitions i get demotivated by her     passive life if you want to call it      please guys share with me what to do as i cant be the only one out there that has these problems  she used to be a gamer but now she doesnt have the drive even for that unless i ask  and again it feels like a chore   ,0.9837,429

0,would you want a friends opinion about how your girlfriend seems to be treating you  hi everyone  first time poster  hope im doing this right  its a bit long   my apologies   i  f    have this really close friend  m     weve known each other for three years  been close friends for two  there has never been anything romantic  sexual or anything like that between us  strictly platonic buddies  my friend  lets call him jack  is a good looking  nice  down to earth guy  he sometimes has a tendency of being a bit awkward and has a very high focus on having a girlfriend in his life  he feels like hes behind because hes    and isnt starting a family yet    he started dating a girl  f    last summer and around august they made the relationship official  now  i am very supportive of him and happy for him  he finally got what he wanted    but  since day one of them dating i have heard only a few good things and the rest have been extremely negative  to the point of where im concerned of him being stuck in a toxic relationship  here are some of the major issues that jack is telling me about  showing me texts from her etc      she constantly picks fights  and when jack agrees with her  shell wait a week and bring up the topic again to start a fight  even though he already agreed with her and apologized  even if it wasnt his fault to begin with      shell cancel plans an hour before theyre supposed to see each other  because jack did  something  she cant specify and needs space  they live an hour from each other  so most times he is already on his way      she broke up with him over text because he talked to me about something they discussed  said she cant trust him and doesnt see a future with him when hes such a backstabber   the topic was something about his apartment which she might move in to      she is very insecure and acts very jealous towards me  its gotten to the point where he lies about seeing me  i called him out on this and told him to be truthful about when we hang out   but when he is truthful she just throws a fit and he spends the entire time texting her and trying to fix it     jack and i have an inside joke where we constantly give each other weird nicknames on fb messenger  in our own private chat  but im no longer allowed to have a nickname in his phone  because according to her that means he is in love with me  no matter how mundane the nickname is      shell get annoyed when he makes plans with his other  male  friends   these are just examples  there are many more  it has been going on from day      he tells me all of these things because  in his words  he needs to know if he is acting unfairly towards her  if he is a bad boyfriend and how he can diffuse these arguments  so they can be happy together    jack and i are hanging out tomorrow and i know he and his girlfriend are planning on moving in together soon  i have already voiced some of my concerns about this relationship to him and told him he needs to set some boundaries  ive already come to terms with the fact that mine and his friendship probably will end when she moves here  but i refuse to let him lose himself completely  ive been in toxic relationship and i know how badly it can screw you up   fyi  i have not met this girlfriend yet  she wants to  take things slow  and not meet friends yet   but  theyre moving in together in under two months lol    if you were jack  would you want your close friend to sit you down and talk about these concerns  ,0.8905,651

0,how do u deal with threats and harrassment  i dont know where else to post  i really need help im in a real bad way atm because of this  or to be directed to where i can get some help and suggestions    first off im    m based in the uk   a few years ago i became friends with someone  lets call him bob   bob seemed like one of my best friends  until i started to realise that he was just a brief respite from an abusive relationship i was trapped in   cars was our thing  we bonded heavily over cars  id often go over there and help him  read  actually do all the work whilst he belittled me in front of his friends   anyway  as i got to know him more and more  i started realising that bob was a total criminal  drug dealing  drug production  fraud  ignoring the law in any way possible  even as far as teching his children to hate the police   so at some point shortly after my relationship with my partner ended i then realized that bob was just using me   i stopped talking to him and after a while started getting abusive messages from him and demanding i pay him the money i owe him   now his story changes constantly and so does the amount i owe him  he seems to think i owe him   k for a car  considering ive never bought a car off him or anything just done a lot of work for him  which i never expected a penny for   so every now and then i would get a messgae demanding money  that i was an ass hole  that we were friends and that he wished hed never met me  i would usually recieve these after he spent a stint in custody   a few times he turned up to my exs home and demand to see me  that he should pay his dues  i cannot stress enough how i genuinely dont owe him anything  he once vandalized her door and wrote       in permanent marker on her door   ive told the police and they say they cant do anything about it unless hes caught in the act  with cctv or the like   the last message i got was a few months ago askjng where his money was and if i didnt contact him within a week that i would recieve a letter and he would see me in court  bonus  i thought  take me to court  i dont owe u a thing  im surprised he even threatened with that considering how much of a criminal record he has   so i left it there  roll on to a couple weeks ago and i get a text off of a different ex with a screenshot of bob messaging her on facebook ordering her to tell me that i need to contact him or he will be paying a visit to area where i used to live but my ex still lives there  this whole thing has already caused so much friction between me and my ex and so many nights without sleep worrying what this guy will do  i dont want to have to tell my ex  yet again  that she needs to worry about bob turning up and being violent   im still baffled as to how he hasnt done time in prison  i know where he lives  it wouls be easy enough for me to retaliate in kind  as im not the spineless door mat i used to be  but then i guarantee that i would be the one ending up with jail time and hed get away with everything   so im now in this horroble situation where im worried that he will randomly bump into me somewhere and be violent or at my exes and be violent  i also know that if i atoop to his level and retaliate and start threatening him that it will full on escelate into him taking it way to far and start vandalising my property  or wait for me outside my kids school   ive informed the police about this harrassment  hes known to them and i they alreayd know my history with him but they cant do anything until he does somwthing and i guarantee that if he does something and the police arrest him and put him into cuatody again that he will then come back out angrier and more violent than ever  last summer i got jumped and knifed on my way back from work  scarred to fuck because of it  i have no proof it was him but i know it was    i cant stress enough how vile this man is  hes a real black mark on society  he cheats the benefits system  steals  drugs  both sells and consumes   ive seen him abuse his girlfriends  ive seen him neglect his children  this man is not a nice man at all and i wish he would fuck up just enough to spend   years in prison so i can save up enough to move away   someone suggest something i can do cos im in a real state right now and have no idea what to do  ,-0.997,862

0,how do you handle feeling stagnant   burned out   just the title basically  but you can read this for context on the specific situation if you want           so just a little context on my personal situation  ive been having a rough journey with mental health  depression anxiety  for about a decade now   ive done many things to improve and handle it better like shifting my life around with fitness  personal development and whatnot  and thats definitely been a major positive factor that helped me go through it a bit more tolerably  but i still feel like   i eventually always come back   to this dark  empty  cold place deep inside    its like i just dont know what kind of expectations to have in life  what to be optimistic for  anything that keeps me sane  ive always found that setting goals and looking forward to certain things made me really optimistic and motivated  but then when i eventually reached those and set higher goals  and then reached those goals too  i feel like i got to a point where i just have an unrealistic  almost impossible  target that i just cant ever reach and makes me question life altogether  not in a hopeless or suicidal type of way  im not that type of person  although ive fell into that place for a temporary period in time   but i just mean that i feel empty and meaningless  like   nothing interests me or that im facing a mid life crisis   in my early   s    basically what i figured is that i kind of kept discovering things that made me feel good and overcome my depression  but then those things were temporary  like the fitness thing  helped for a while then it stopped having much of an effect  i decided i needed a life and tried to pursue that  then i managed to do certain things i wanted in terms of social life  and then i realized i actually need to make a certain income  a certain lifestyle  etc   and its like i feel i uncovered something that ive never even thought about or expected ever before   going through certain experiences and situations  with girls  lifestyle  etc   and its like this became my new equilibrium  so im longing for this thing now and yet i get pushed back into my old state and other obstacles  due to being young with certain responsibilities and being at a certain stage in life  that make me feel like im totally lost and dont have any purpose   not to mention that its ultimately the fact that i feel like my new goal is so farfetched it kinda does make me feel hopeless   i dont know if that makes sense  its kinda hard to explain it broadly without going into detail and a wall of text  but the most simple terms i can say it is like  i first got into fitness in teens  felt great with the results  maybe would get attention in school and that meant something for me   then i realize im almost done being a teen and wanna have a cool social life and build memories  i go through a tough time then find some mild success  meet some people and go out to some clubs and travel some places  but then i realize theres so much more to it and how i actually now need a certain lifestyle in general to do the other stuff i came across  like meeting other people  and going out to other types of clubs  and traveling to other types of places  doing other new things which i suddenly want and feel like i should be doing    and then the issue with relationships   which is the main thing that got me thinking about this whole thing  but is totally irrelevant to my goal   ive never really been involved with girls until i was like     im almost    now  and it was more serious during the past year  ive managed to go on dates with girls that i really never thought that i would be able to see   and then i kind of just felt like a kid again who has been introduced to a whole new world of stuff and things to strive for that ive gotten lost  i dont know if that makes sense but basically i keep thinking about my future and the goals i want on one point  and then on living and experiences on the other end   i just feel like the former would help me with the second  and that i actually need to do certain things  almost unrealistic  to sustain it and achieve the things i want  but then again i feel like because its such a farfetched goal  i am gonna miss out and feel miserable empty because i most probably wont achieve the goal  again  keeps changing and getting more complicated   nor end up making use of the experiences which i missed out on   ,0.9977,820

0,stupid but lucky to be alive so were do i begin my story started as a kid i was schooled at first got good grades and had friends bit it all got started when my school got held back in  rd grade because no one was inrolling in  rd grade apparently so they sent me back even though i did pass the  rd grade so my mom saw this and took me out of there because i already knew everything my memory was sharp as can be but then my mom put me in home school and i dont blame her she was a hard worker and had to raise not only me but my siblings as well but the home school was like dvds the academy sent us the problem was since my mother was always working she never knew i would skip class and my sister would fill out my work for me  her mind i guess she was already thinking of what would happened if i didnt at least have a fighting chance in a high school diploma so she kept this up while i got drunk on video games wasting my peak skip    years later i got my first job and i was so scared because i didnt know anything my month was the only thing keeping me afloat skip a month i got fired because the trainer didnt want to train me i dont blame him though i probably wouldnt have learned anything or am i just saying that skip   more years and finally got a stable job    an hour in a food factory i started with fear in my eyes but i kept my chin high and hoped for the best and actually became a decent worker although i quit that job because the boss was an asshole lasted   years there helping everyone one i could out never knowing that one of there employees had an education level of a  rd grader and i have a job a but its part time i did so i can study but i see theres alot to learn and and i panic all the money i have saved up in my other job is going down i saved alot because am scared that one of these days my mother will die and i dont know if i can make a check or get myself a place to live and i hate it that i see my mom smiling and working hard and still helping me in my life why i struggle learning fucking times tables if it was here she would see me fat and happy on a couch well i cant see her busting her ass while i do nothing it hurts me to my core seeing she would sell her life just to see me happy and it hurts cause deep down in my heart i know she would do it without hesitation on me fucking no one who didnt put his effort on books and in school someone who wasted his life on video games just to figure out life hits harder than anytything ever could and i cant see my mother working anymore shes really old and if i had a choice i would rather see her at home relaxing from all the hard work and love she put into me and as a man i ask why why doesnt she treat me like the trash that i am but no she would still love me no matter what and its driving me insane i feel like i cant do shit  when i had my other job i would spoile her but now with this  part time job and me trying to catch up i ask this question as a scared little boy whos trying to be a strong man to protect and help the ones he loves is it to late for me can i still change can a stupid kid who doesnt know anything still have a chance to see his dream to become normal    happen   ,0.9881,675

0,when was a time where you felt like you had to help a woman  what did you do  why did you do it  today as i was walking during rush hour i decided to take a busier street  i was in a pretty good mood  walking and listening to music  as i was walking i noticed a homeless man who i would be passing  he seemed to look in my direction but didn t blatantly look at me so i didn t pay it any mind but i was just aware  i continued to walk down the block  stopping at a crosswalk and waited for the light to turn to the walk sign and noticed a man walking behind me but again didn t think much of it as it was during rush hour so i expected the streets to be busy  the light changed and i proceeded to walk the crosswalk  as i approached the next block  it was then that i noticed the same homeless man  he ran past me only to turn around and start walking towards my direction again and before i could think the homeless man stopped in his tracks causing me to stop and i tried to get out of his way only for him to come right in my direction again  there was maybe four feet between us  again i tried to move to get out of his way and he quickly got right back in my way  at this moment i felt like i was in fight or flight mode but before i could react he took a step and looked liked he was going to lunge forward and attack me  before i knew it the man who was walking closely behind me before i crossed the street came to my aide and protected me by shielding me from this homeless man and making sure i was alright  he walked with me a bit and made sure the homeless man didn t turn back around to follow me again  it all happened so fast and i was still in shock that all i could utter was a thank you before i walked away  i didn t catch his name but i just want to stay thank you to this stranger and to any other men who has helped anyone else in danger  as a woman  you guys really have no idea what this means  so thank you    tl dr  i was almost attacked today and a man helped me  i could never say enough thank you s to him or any other man who has done this for other women  so i just wondering if there was ever a time where you helped a woman who seemed to be in danger  what did you do and why did you do it  what was going on in your head at the time that made you just react and help her  ,-0.4302,487

0,any guys here have a relationship with a girl who you thought was the one only to have external circumstances get in the way  what happened  i   m met girl  f in july  we connected on a crazy level  that same wavelength kind of shit  it was amazing  never met anyone like her and vice versa  she got some bad news in august and we abruptly stopped talking  august sucked pretty bad for me  and september was a little better  we started talking again at the end of september with the agreement of just being friends   that agreement lasted all of two days and we ended up getting closer and closer  she told me she loved me in the middle of october  we officially became a couple in november  she ended up getting more bad news about one of her parents  health two days later and became incredibly distant  i didn t see her for the entire month we were an official couple  two of those weeks she was out of town visiting her parent   we broke up after our first legit argument which was me wanting to see her  and her not having capacity  she blew up on me and took a lot of things i said completely out of context and used them against me which she never did before  i apologized profusely but to no avail  we were done  i called her two days after we broke up  just to apologize for how things played out  and that i acknowledged we weren t fit to be in a relationship at the moment due to the shit she has going on as well as my own attachment issues  but that i didn t think the way this played out was reflective of how a relationship would be with us if the external circumstances didn t introduce themselves at the beginning of our relationship  not blaming her at all  it was just bad timing for something to happen   she never responded   i had bad anxiety the last two weeks we were talking and once we broke up it was completely alleviated  like i had my answer  it s been a month and a half and i just miss her like crazy  not just at a romantic level  but as a person  i had to block her on all social media  but i kept her phone number  i don t plan on reaching out to her any time soon  but i may down the road  i m not hoping for anything at this point and have been doing great things since we broke up  but i still think about her all the time   anyway  have you guys experienced anything remotely similar  how would you handle this going forward  ,-0.9825,458

0,what should i do with this girl  which option should i pick  will try to keep it short   so i met this girl at a festival in nyc last november  the first night was quick a couple of minutes ang got her insta  the second day dmed and saw her again and we danced for hours but nothing really happened expect of a quick goodbye kiss    dmed the next day and found out she is just visiting and got home  louisiana   we kept texting and calling each other with no pressure at all  like we would spend days without call text and very normal for one of us to only text back the next day or so  very chill   i knew that she was getting into me  stating how amazing i was and actually always initiating and wanting to call me and to not forget her  on my birthday  in december  she said as a gift she will buy a flight tix to ny and come visit me  which she did and came last weekend this january    to be honest  i wasnt really excited  i m always active and have some many things going on  in a good way  that keeps me busy and not having the time to really think about those things and get my feelings attached  also don t want to me  cause it breaks my rhythm like now lol    unfortunately  when she came  i did a lot of mistakes which arent big deal but im not that stupid and i know that they would accumulate and especially from a girls prospective they mean something     mistake   i called after work to meet her  i live in n nj  and we planned to meet in nj then go together to nyc  but she already went there and need to come back to change for the night and i was like  why didnt you wait  now we have to go twice  pay toll again but also its crazy ass traffic in nyc at rush hour   where i should have not think about those  i mean she came to visit and here i am pointing about things that make her sound not important to me    anyways  i wait for her call to go to her place and pick her up  we went to the party  we were both rolling   everything was great  no details needed    mistake  we got home to my place  which was already planned this way  so we can finish our little after party  i am a dj so first thing turned on the mixer and started playing  i believe the second mistake was not paying really attention to her and got into the music that i forget that i should probably put a set playing itself and lay down with her and just enjoy each other  after putting a last song playing for   mins or so  we were kissing pretty intensely and meanwhile she called a lyft stating she has to do some stuff in the morning    mistakes  she got a shooting the next day in brooklyn and the plan was to join her  but it was snowing badly and pretty cold and im just going to see her getting pictures for two hours  so i said i meet afterwards   which is probably another mistake making her sound like less important     mistakes  i text around  pm checking if she got home  not yet  the plan  we  re going to my friends place in nyc for his birthday  she said     pm would be good  i asked please do me a favor and try to be ready around    she said just go and will catch me   i should went to her place and sit there until she finishes  more time together   her flight was at  am tomorrow and she wanna pack before leaving  texting her throughout the night keeping her update as my friends kept changing plans    we went to a bar and she ended up showing around     am  she brought edible as a gift   the night was great  we danced and had a blast  i offered to drive her home  but she rejected and said no worries gotta go  around     am     i realized i forgot some ecstasy at her place  which i think she did it on purpose  but who knows  not important detail   i texted her to come and once there  she asked if im alone  told her my friend waiting in the car   but also cant stay  she has to go to the airport in about    hours   itwas  am    we got good kisses and some quick goodbyes   the rest is through those texts                    am    me                     am    her                     pm    me   princesa  landed all good and arrived home   her  just got home  and dying slowly   hahaha  forgot to tell you  thanks for everything   me  hahaha glad you re finally home  and it was a pleasure for me seeing you here  i wanna thank you  go rest and do you thing and call me if you get a chance tonight  besoss  she didn t call by the way                   am    her  omg  fall asleep yesterday at      pm  woke up for   minutes  fall asleep again and just woke up again because i had a nightmare lol    can t believe it  anyways  hope you have a great day today      me  i can imagine  you had a pretty intense weekend  lacking so much sleep  buenas dias para tu and take good care of yourself    no call been made this then and sent the voice message at     pm which she heard and saved at  pm that goes a bit like this    i literally wanna thank you for putting the effort and investing in visiting me  what you did is pretty crazy  done in a tight schedule  it was pretty much a hustle  if anyone does this to me  i would be speechless and dont really like being in this position where someone overdo something to me  i also wanted to take you to so many other places and  i think i didnt welcome you the right way  but at the same time i wanted to give you your space and let you feel free to do whatever suits best for you  i hope im not wrong  but i believe youre a great person inside out and if i see you again  i hope i will get the chance to give back to you even a little bit  again  thank you so much keep on smiling with that beautiful smile and take good care of yourself  muchos besos   since then she just saved the message  which means she heard it  and never replied back   before even sending the voice message i knew that i messed up with her and expected her not to reply back  if she was in nj  i wouldn t bother and try again but since she is in another state  i have nothing to lose   i said im gonna take this opportunity and learn from it  add it to my experience  rather than not reaching out  im gonna do the opposite  im not expecting anything from her but wanna test for future occasion and learn  so redditers  here i am skiing for your help and sorry for this long post   option   just call  if no answers or no call back  thats it  option   send a voice message saying  hey i know youre mad at me and i wanna say sorry  maybe state my mistakes  then say im gonna leave it here and if dont hear back from you  then that means that i should leave you on your own and wish all the best blah blah blah  option   send a text instead which says the same thing as option   i prefer voice   option    just send a text like nothing happened and say something like   hey girl  how have you been  feeling recovered from nyc   option    call  if no answer  leave a text  one of the option     or     option    send her something funny on instagram related to her somehow  like nothing happened   option    text   hey whats going on  ask about the shooting how did it go and go from there maybe ask for a pic or so  option   send a voice message saying whatever i want and goodbye for real like no more reaching out  a way to close things out in my mind and turn the page  option    up to you guys  what should i do  also girls   if you were in this situation  what do you wanna hear   something i wanna say  im really not desperate or needy  im enjoying my life but those are things that happens and thought for once i should give reddit a try and also always wanna learn  and big thank to whoever took the time to read and help me out   ps  i know why  but its crazy how a person who was so into you and even talking about us together with children and stuff and then no more at all after a couple of hours for some undirect mistakes  i know the right option is to forget and move one  but don t really want to for now ,0.9997,1516

0,girlfriend abusive  testing me  what am i dealing with  tl dr    year  into the relationship and first like for  real  relationship but i know in reality it isnt because of our age  i am     shes      me and my girlfriend that are in long distance used to talk and call every day   maybe lately i was too available for her and it probably annoyed her  she made me also lose trust  and made me like controlling and suspect her i admit its not good any tips for that  let me know please    it let to her respond slower at first  and not answer calls directly   so i talked about it and she now suddenly tells me calling every day is not right and that she didnt want to see me every day and also she was bored and easily irritated  i told her you need space  she tells me no  im not taking space from relationship and tells me  i always love you  but i know she is also influenced by her sisters and talking about me behind my back   she became emotionally distant   is she testing me to see if i can live without her    remember before it all happened it came in stages and this is the aftermath   day    almost no response   times maybe  and a   missed call of her just because i wanted but she didnt look interested  i called her later  instead and a pop up came she was in another call and she still didnt respond to my text  so i called her out  called her  devil  for treating me like this and then  she  wanted to throw a tantrum for me saying that it took her very long to reply  the next day she says i wasnt on a  call  later she admits she called and tells me its not a boy or something like that but  someone important  childish right   i think either she was testing me or something really happened  on this day it took her hours to reply at certain times  sometimes   or      but i didnt feel any remorse because basically it made me think she is not worth it and i accepted mentally that she isnt my girlfriend anymore  and shockingly when watching a random youtube video  and saw a girl talking and my brain said this  thats what my  ex would think  i said it unconsciously to myself   so i told her why are you still behaving like that  she told me im not gonna break up with you and i am not seeing someone else   but i dont believe it  i dont really care that much anymore  because she pushes me away  and to be honest i am more hurt for getting treated this way   day    i wasnt gonna initiate any texts anymore  we didnt even talk or something but she kept me up to date sometimes on what she was doing and more then the first day  and tells me at the end of the day  sorry that i didnt have much time for you  i love you always    i got really pissed because it isnt true  but i held it in me  and told her kindly just goodnight   she tells me i call you tomorrow  but i am not excited at all to see her and feel like ignoring or maybe worse breaking up  i know that even if she will call me  she would still be slow responsive and not call me everyday and treat me like dirt   conclusion      she says im not taking space but she isnt putting any effort into relationship  but she tells me she isnt  is my girlfriend trying to convince me her behaviour is normal  we used to call every day and text eachother because we are in long distance      any hope left of her behaving like she used to be  is this a phase   i didnt have problems with us seeing often because of the distance  but it isnt right  i cannot see the person  i love  but she clearly is not the same anymore   she just told me i love you and i always do  but words is nothing  its just words it doesnt make me feel in love or give me hope  because of the way i get treated i find it manipulative and abusive is she abusing me   i know its not true what she says and how she behaves  its like she is changing the rules for her own favour and i feel tested   any advice    thank you for reading  ,0.9832,754

0,how to deal with my best friend moving away my best friend is leaving soon to go to mexico for a study abroad trip  and i just said goodbye to him tonight until the next time i see him in june  i haven t been handling it very well  he s my smoking buddy  movie watching buddy   am trip to the grocery store buddy  and i m gonna lose all of that for   months  i have other good friends here at college  so it s not like i ll be entirely alone  but i worry that not having him around is something i won t be able to get over  luckily  the silver lining in all of this is that him leaving will make me focus really hard on school  which is important for me with it being my first semester of nursing school  i ll smoke way less  probably eat healthier  and hopefully focus more on school  i know that it s for the best because it s important to him  he feels like living in the us sucks  and frankly it kinda does  and he thinks his life is just gonna be fucking incredible when he lives there  he mentioned to me last night when we had dinner at one of our favorite places for the last time that if he loves it when he s down there  he s considering staying down there permanently  obviously i d love for him to get to live a better life  but i know mine would be really hard without him  i know i m probably being a little bitch for getting upset about my friend leaving for only a few months  but it s torn me down today  i listened to dark side of the moon  one of our favorite albums  and i cried a lot  these next few months are gonna be interesting to say the least  and i m not ready for such a drastic change  with him leaving and nursing school starting   maybe i ll get a girlfriend and replace him lol ,0.9906,345

0,i ve been blocked by my ex girlfriend for about a week now  should i stop wasting my time  she may be manipulative  i    m  met her      during college  through tinder   she started her graduate studies in neuroscience for a phd  and i was finishing up my undergraduate studies for computer science  just graduated   the first time i met her  we were getting to know each other and it was a blast  we had so much in common  she was intelligent  funny  and beautiful  about a week in  we started hooking up  and a week later  she asked me if i am her boyfriend  and i said yes  but there were multiple major red flags diving deep into the relationship    red flags  she told me that she had been contacting her long term ex boyfriend as a friend and seemingly hasn t moved on from him  he s about     miles away from our college town   she always hides her phone screen from me whenever i m near her presence  and one of my friends found her tinder profile still up   weeks into dating her    so by the time it was almost finals and the semester was about to end  the day before her birthday  i thought it would be a great idea to tag her in a  in a relationship  status just to surprise her  i mean    weeks into dating and we were working on something together  so i felt it was the right time  this backfired  and she told me that she likes to keep her private life  private   she then had to explain to her friends  family  mom  and ex about me  i apologized and tried to explain that it was a mistake  but she replied by blocking me on facebook  probably to hide any ties with her   i thought this was odd  a week after this conundrum  we spent some time together in her apartment  and while we were getting ready for bed  she asked me to give her her phone downstairs  i thought to myself that this was the moment i get to know the truth  i started snooping  unacceptable  but necessary  her messages and i found a text message from a guy who asked if she s down for dinner while we were dating  she didn t respond to him  or she probably deleted her responses   but i confronted her about it  she then said to me  if you think i m cheating on you  you should leave   she then broke down  and i said it s okay  trying to calm her down since she was having panic attacks  the next early morning while she was sleeping  things didn t add up to me  so i managed to snoop her phone again  this time  i found out she s been in contact with multiple guys in the area through text  comprising of when she s available in the evenings  and her matching on tinder  no flirtatious messages   but the worst of it all  her text message to her ex boyfriend made my heart palpitate  she explained to him that the  in a relationship  status was fake  claiming that i  was a graduate student who wanted her attention and stalk her or something   then her ex suggested to talk shit about me if she had any mutual friends  i confronted her about it  she threatened to call the police on me but she cried and tried to explain her innocence   and i naively forgave her   so the next day  i sent her an essay of wanting to break up with her going along the lines of  i m breaking up with you  you re cheating on me  and i want my things back  she said in reply  thank you for all the bullshit assumptions and for saying i love you about an hour ago  was that just to play with my emotions  nice to know literally everything wanting to be with me meant nothing  goodbye  op  she then explained to me that she uses tinder because she s conceited and prideful  that she uses for attention  i then  out of misery  said that i still love her  and she replied back with  and i still love you   we then agreed to keep each other as  friends for now  the following day because we obviously have strong feelings for each other    so after graduation and during christmas break  i burned a lot of bridges and crossed boundaries from our  break   i sent her an essay demanding for reciprocal love during her time in work  instead of calling her i showed up unexpectedly to her apartment to ask if she s moving on  and to get my things back   and my phone call conversations always consisted of me asking her if she still loves me and everything  then i accused her that  i know you ve moved on  after i found her tinder profile   days ago  she said in reply that my accusations are narrative  that i am putting her on edge all of the time  and that she dearly loved me  and this caused her to block me partially everywhere  after realizing i ve been blocked on my phone  i frantically started freaking out and was delirious  i managed to contact her via email  asking for a way to elaborate and clarify that i still trust her  she then sent me the following email      i m sorry  i literally don t know what else to do  i m just sitting here crying and i can t keep doing this  i feel like you keep me on edge all of the time because i never know what you might do or say  you take narratives and run with them  i start my classes tomorrow morning and i don t think it would be helpful if we talked right now  but i also don t think it would be helpful in general if we were talking at all for the time being  please understand  i m so sorry  i don t know how to handle this  i think you are an awesome  amazing person and i would like to talk again  but stuff like this keeps happening and it s not okay  this hurts me so much  and i know it must hurt you too  but i think its for the best  you will always be in my heart  please take care of yourself and be safe  dont isolate yourself  talk with your friends and relatives  im going to get better too and everything will be okay  maybe in the future we can talk again  i dont know  but i do know that i need to be okay first    i then replied her that i ll respect her well being  that i agree that this is probably the best for both of us  and that i dearly loved her and i m sorry that i ve been a shitty guy    shen then told me  i appreciate that  also  i don t think you re a shitty guy so please don t beat yourself up over anything  thank you for understanding    i can t get over her  it felt like our love was real  but  i don t even know anymore  i don t even think i can trust anyone like her as well  ,0.9989,1214

0,how should you help your best friend with heartbreak for context  one of my best friends is a poor starving artist whos trying to make it in life  we decided that we would open up a company together  he has pretty low self esteem as his family has never treated him right and always treated him like a failure for being a poor starving artist  he never really had the greatest grades in school and has been pretty down on his luck his whole life and it doesnt help that weve known each other for most of our lives and ive always been relatively successful in most of my endeavors like school and stuff and so he has always had his family compare him to me  which was not my intention at all  i just have a strict family  so i had to do well   but hes a genuinely nice guy and has helped me out many times   so my best friend fell in love with a girl  but the girl decided to end their relationship after kinda playing around with his heart  hes been pretty devastated and has been down on his luck this whole time  he talked to me about his self worth and how he felt himself growing older and not having much success in life and how he has always felt like a failure and how the girl playing with him made him feel worthless as though there was nothing good nor talented about him  its an odd thing  even if hes my best friend and not family  his pain felt as if it were my pain  almost as though the girl had played with me instead of him  i didnt know exactly how to help with it  so i told him what i personally thought about relationships myself  i personally believe that relationships are there to test compatibility and that its better to test them sooner rather than later  however i felt that it was a crummy   perhaps too logical answer  and dont believe i helped cheer him up  so i i said that i would be there for him and that if he needed me i would talk  im not sure what else i can do about it but its painful seeing him so down when i know hes got immense talent within himself even if no one else thinks he does  ,0.9936,398
0,bf broke up but wants to be friends   when we broke up he said he didn t want to end on a bad note and that he still wants me in his life  just as a friend  he briefly offered we could just take a break but i was just like if you want to break up than we ll break up and he didn t press it further he said the reason he wanted to break up was i flirted with a guy several months ago and while he s been trying to trust me it s been really hard  especially since i m in the military so i m away from him surrounded by a bunch of guys several days a month  any thoughts on this  i read a psychology article awhile back that said if exes are friends after a breakup they re either still in love or never were    and i was definitely in love with him and he was always good to me     we still text each other asking how each other s days were and if we re okay etc etc but i don t want to stay friends with him if he s just keeping me in his life as a type of side chick even though he s not that kind of guy     any thoughts on this  especially from guys please because y all can give better perspective into the male brain ,0.993,240
0,does he like me or am i overreacting  i bumped into this guy who i went to hs with at the airport  we ll call him drew  we never really talked before but we did have mutual friends  anyway  we both had some small talk and found out that we were both heading to hawaii on the same flight  during this time i was pregnant and meeting my boyfriend in hawaii while drew was meeting up with his parents  not only were we on the same flight but we were actually seated together  at the time  i was annoyed cause i m pregnant and i was hoping to catch some sleep  we ended up talking the whole flight    hours   i kept the conversation going because i hate awkward silence  anyway  people around us would congratulate us thinking that we were a couple but before i could correct them  he went along with it by thanking people  i thought it was innocent jokes so i didnt care    after the flight  he texted me saying that he still couldn t believe that we were seated next to each other and claimed it was  fate     a month later i find out that we were both taking the same online college course  i had just given birth so i have a family  over the course of the semester he texted me everyday talking about his family  what he was doing  and even about his bio mom abandoning him  our conversations would go on the whole day until  am  im up at this time of course cause i have a newborn  i just thought he needed a friend to rant to  didn t think too much of it    he would ask for pictures of my daughter saying that shes so cute and getting so big and that he couldn t wait to meet her    one day he called me huffing and puffing about how this guy he was supposed to get tattooed from flaked on his appointment  drew wanted to go to this guys house and fight or whatever  i tried to calm him down  he txted me after thanking me    it was friendly up until the point where he sent me pictures of his new tattoo on his chest and his neck  i talked to my bf about it and he thinks that drew likes me     if that s the case  i want to set boundaries but in a polite way   what is your opinion  ,0.9545,411

0,guys who train use dumbbells or weights  how much do you regularly lift   so i m just curious what the regular weight that most guys lift is    i usually stuck to exclusively body weight exercises but since my parents started supporting me getting into better shape  i ve been expanding on the range of what i try and do    my mother  who has never even been in a gym and is overweight  suggested picking up some weights at a local place    so i got a pair of  lbs and a pair of   lbs    then my dad  who worked out twice a week over    years ago  told me that at    i should be lifting atleast       lb and working towards a minimum of   lb  per arm    to be honest  i m actually stronger than i expected myself to be and   lb is feeling not light but i can barely notice the weight and it takes very little to no effort to do anything with them    what s an ideal weight to use or  since i m assuming it varies from person to person  how much do you guys lift per arm   ,0.9521,189
0,have any of you guys experienced a painful penis after sex  i took some tadalafil tonight to give it a try and admittedly it does indeed make the penis more sensitive and it makes you stay harder for longer    i ended up having some great sex and lasted the longest ive been able to in a long time  but near the end my penis started to throb and not in a good way  it started to feel numb  it wasn t  and i started getting strange electrical shocks up my urethra  i m guessing this was all down to my penis staying engorged with blood for a prolonged period   now i m sitting here with what feels like a bruise and swollen penis yet everything looks absolutely fine    i think i ll give the tadalafil a miss from now on    maybe some of you younger guys get this without tadalafil when you re on a marathon  ,-0.7367,156

0,how does a guy struggling with his finances explains his situation to a new date  i have been lurking for a while and this is something that i keep thinking about when it comes to start a new relationship   im a middle aged man  never married but with a young kid from a previous relationship  i have a good job and im working hard to try to get a promotion and improve my professional prospect  but due to very questionable financial decision in the past i am barely surviving   im working really hard to get my finances in order and im proud of the fact that i paid of one loan and will take care of two  or possibly three  this year  things are looking up but besides the times i spend with my kid im mostly alone because i think i cant afford dating   my last girlfriend and i broke up because we couldnt talk about money  we were both middle aged parents with young kids  but she thought i was  cheap  even though i paid for most of our dates   we enjoyed our time together and got along well with each other kids  but we were both  struggling financially and had diametrically opposite approach to money management   after that experience i put even more urgency on getting a good grip on my finances  i cut my expenses even more  cut my    k contributions to the minimum    but mostly spend my free time at home watching tv or reading    that was depressing  and i struggled with depression for a long time when i was younger  so i updated my dating profile and starting swiping left and right   well  a couple of weeks ago a very attractive middle aged divorcee liked what she saw and contacted me  we had a nice conversation and ended up exchanging numbers   i called her yesterday and agree on going on a date on friday and i really need your advice on how to approach this situation if we get serious   i know i shouldnt left past experiences mess up new ones and i know that if a woman tells me that im cheap for whatever reason thats a red flag that cant be ignored    also important to mention because i think is relevant is that im an immigrant to the usa and in my culture the man always pays for everything and even though im very assimilated i feel really ashamed to let a lady pay for half the bill when we go out    which is silly  because even my last ex actually paid for some dates herself   i feel like im rambling and i dont even know if i have good long term prospect with this lady  but for the future  how should i go about regarding my finances and dating   i honestly dont even know where to start  ,0.9845,476

0,how to proceed with gym crush we ve been going to the same gym for quite a while  but i ve only noticed in the last couple of months that he d stare at me  at first  i thought this was maybe by chance  but then it happened too often so i figured there was more to it   i did one of those smile nod things to him a few times and he d keep staring  so naturally  i started paying more attention  he would often look over at me from afar and glance over  if i looked back  he d look away and that happens quite a bit  when we walk passed each other  he wouldn t make eye contact  then  in the last week  i noticed he d actually put his head down when he d see me approaching from afar  and turn his head away  i asked him last week if he was using these weights by him  and when he saw me approach  he put his head down and just nodded no without speaking or looking up   i also feel like he s on nearby machines often or just generally in the same area  but that could also be coincidence    i went back and forth on whether i should even say hi   it seemed like i made him slightly uncomfortable if he can t make eye contact  plus  i certainly don t feel look that attractive in the gym  then today  he was getting spotted by my friend so i thought in the least this could make for good conversation   he was at the machine next to me at the end of my workout  so i finally got the courage to introduce myself  he was super nice and actually not really shy at all   we talked about our workout for the day and where we re from in the area and so forth  he even said he noticed how much i can lift and called me strong  which in the least makes me think he wants me to know he s looked over     i said i hope it wasn t weird that i came up to him and he said he was glad i did and it wasn t since we see each other practically every weekday  we talked for like   minutes and he was actually the one who kept trying to talk more  we shook hands and said we d see each other tomorrow    so i m just really bad at reading signs  but it kind of seems like he may be interested as well  i want to see how the conversation goes for this week and if we actually do more than just wave  then maybe i d ask him by the end of the week if he wants to grab a coffee sometime  should i wait longer than that  should i try to gauge how interested he actually is isn t since we just spoke for the first time  tia   tl dr  introduced myself to my gym crush today  should i ask him out for coffee by the end of the week or wait  ,0.9961,521

0,my life long best friend wants to date me  i ve known my best friend since we were kids  we grew up together  then he moved away but visited every summer vacation  he was the first guy i kissed and dated  first time in  th grade  it went wrong  he liked a friend of mine and kinda dumped me   then in   th grade  same thing   he was having drug issues and was all over the place and screamed at me and locked me up in a room    i stopped talking to him after the  nd dating attempt  he got sober and   years later apologised for being such an asshole until i forgave him and we became friends again   then once a year or so he asked for another chance to be with me  i always said  no  because i never wanted to get hurt again   he was always judgemental of who i was dating and was always asking for a new chance only after his relationships were failing  he had this romantic idea that we should be together bc we knew each other since we were in diapers  but it felt like a desperate last resort option  i never felt like a priority   that happened for years until i introduced him to a colleague of mine      years ago  and he basically married her after a couple of months of dating  i made up some excuse and did not go to the wedding   i couldnt believe he was so nice with her and with me he never had been  despite me always being there for him  he got upset and we didnt talk for a year  but then we reconnected again and were best friends again  i even visited him and his wife and i was happy for him  he was an emotional wreck before her  had alcohol problems and then he became like the best version of himself  so i understood her personality brought out the best in him and i was trully happy for him   he was sometimes rubbing it in my face that he could have married me instead  but apart from this  it all seemed awesome until they had a baby and he told me he was cheating on his wife  he said they were not having sex and this was an arrangement they had made   at the same time  we spent an evening together watching a movie and all of a sudden i started feeling things for him  which totally freaked me out because i had never had any romantic feelings for years for him   plus i was seeing someone else  i basically ran away from his flat in the middle of the night  i told him about my feelings and we decided to just move on   at the baptism of his kid he was super strange   totally ignored me  we still hanged out whenever he visited  we live in different places  then he called me to wish me a happy ny   which he never does and told me he got a divorce  i was shocked  he seemed so happy with his wife  only mentioned she is bad with money  but nothing more    we hanged out and stayed up late drinking and talking  he told me everything about the marriage  and then   again  hinted at us being together  told me he doesnt feel as close as he is to me with nobody else and that he had been separated from his wife  but they had kept it private since she was pregnant  so the night we watched the movie and got close he was not with her anymore    it got me thinking  should i give this a chance if we happen to both be single at the same time  i am physically atttracted to him  i love him a lot  what happened happened in our teens  now we are in our thirties  but i still have this feeling that he wants more the idea of me and a romantic dream than who i am  and that no matter how convincing he may sound  i should stay the fuck away  all his relationships ended within   years time  they all started and ended the same  and he never wanted to go to therapy or do some soul searching   just partied until the next one  then got sober again and so on now he is still seeing the girl he cheated on with because she totally adores him and he hates being alone  which i kinda get but i dont know    it feels selfish  and i dont like the way he treats her  most of the time he is nice to her  but he sometimes treated her like a servant  or like she is stupid    not ok  she is also much younger than us    tl dr  should i date my best friend  we re in our thirties  been friends since we were born  through many ups and down  but i dont feel i can trust him  ,0.9979,827

0,how do you know if you should stop pursuing a girl  so heres my situation  ive known this girl for about three years now  we are together in a band  but outside of that we never actually spent time alone together untill recently  ive had a crush on her for a while now  but didnt want to make a move  because she didnt seem to be interested in me  but a couple weeks ago we were kinda forced to hang out by chance for a couple of hours and it was really great  we were talking about a lot of different things and laughed at each other a lot and all that stuff  so i decided i should ask her out for a coffee or something  i did  she said yes  we hung out  it was really cool  i didnt make any moves  we just had a fun time  then we started texting  it seemed ok at first  but then it turned really onesided  me sending stuff and her responding  although the responses seemed enthusiastic  they didnt lead the convo anywhere   our schedules are really packed and most of the week we are in different cities  so i asked her out for coffee again the next week  she said yes  it was cool again  we were both really tired after a long day  but it was still fun  knowing that we are in the same city the next day i suggested that she called me if she had any time  she did not  but ok  that didnt matter to me much  i saw a movie playing that day in the cinema in town and asked her if she had time  she said she was busy and nothing else  i then suggested another date when the movie was playing next week and she said yes  we had a little bit of contact during the week through texts  but it was still mostly one sided  so the day comes  she was working a bit late and came to the caffe about half an hour before the movie started  so we didnt have that much time to talk before the movie but it was still nice  then after the movie she just said she needs to go  so it ended really weirdly  she was feeling a bit under the weather though  so it was kinda understandable  and she sent me a text saying she is sorry when she came home  the next day when ended up still texting a little bit  but then the convo died out again  i really like this girl  but i am really confused if she likes me back or not  its really hard to tell  sorry for the long read  have a good one  ,0.9941,456

0,should i marry her  i love this girl  but i m not sure  we re both    and in a long distance relationship so i am feeling a little pressure to make up my mind  since this is a serious question this won t be short  but i am at a loss and would appreciate any advice   about a year ago i lost my job  i m born in the states but have croatian roots with tons of family there  so i decided no better time to see family then when you don t have to book a return ticket  so i did    along the way i met a croatian girl who seemed absolutely amazing     she was sweet  she had a successful business  she spoke my language and seemed to share common values  i had a   figure job in the states and i live in the south where it s common for women to date men for their financial support so they could be stay at home wives  so the fact that we would go to dinner and this girl would pay for our bill while i was in the restroom made a huge impression  plus she cooks  cleans  washes clothes  irons  gets me presents but perhaps the most defining aspect of this relationship to me is  we ve never been in an argument despite how brutally honest i am    because i was a traveler  i moved in with her   weeks in to the relationship  got a job  stayed for   months and every day was so pleasant because it was croatian beaches  and no arguing or relationship stress    the only issue is the sexual chemistry is not on par with other girls i ve dated  i ve never liked the way she kissed from the first moment and i don t really ever  lust  for her  i m a healthy male and she is an attractive     blonde so we have regular sex     times a week along with a great social life  we travel  go out  she is supportive etc  and while i check out other girls all the time  our sex is not bad and the ease and regularity that i get it keeps me from straying  also  i love and respect her and i wouldn t cheat on her      now living in croatia for   months i explained that the economy and opportunities don t compare  i explained that if i and we wanted to have a life and future and provide the best for children in the future it would not be in croatia    so    months later i moved back trying to start a franchise with my savings in order to support her  we now live   times zones away and the plan is for her to find a way to sell her business while i ramp up and then she comes here  but i m getting cold feet   she doesn t know too much english  i m sure she ll learn  but i brought her for a tour in the summer and she loved it  honestly she d make a perfect mother and a great match for me  i lean towards the skeptic negative side and she so positive  supportive and caring  she s great with kids and she knows my culture language religion and we don t argue  i ve tried   she is cute but i always wanted     brunette and she s a     blonde whose kiss doesn t turn me on     she has her own successful business in croatia and all her family is there so it s asking a lot for her to leave it    and i don t want to do that to her if things did not go well in our marriage    i mean talk about messing both of our lives up   i also don t know how to communicate my hesitations    so i wonder if there are other guys that have been through something similar that can share their own experience advice  ,0.9989,657

0,how to make lasting male friendships in your late twenties tldr     male who has struggled to make lasting friendships seeks advice on how to make and hold friendships  and what exactly you should expect from a good male to male friendship   i m    and am in a bit of a social rut   i ve been sick for about two years  and while i have made some friends during that time  i ve had a hard time extending those friendships beyond the contexts that i meet them in   i do have one good mate  but he lives far away and we only catch up about twice a month  sometimes it can be a couple of months before we see each other  i have another good friend from childhood  but he lives in a different city so we don t speak much  we play phone tag a lot    i have a girlfriend who is great  but i need more male friends  i m not socially bereft  but i am lonely sometimes and would like to make some more meaningful friendships with guys my own age   i tried mini war gaming through a local hobby store and met some guys through that  some are cool  some are just weird  it s hit and miss when i bump into them because the store isn t near where i live  i ve been thinking about potentially trying another store as well just for variety   but truthfully i m just nowhere near as into it as they are  and they don t seem to have a lot of interests beyond it really  they ll be sitting there geeking out about rules and stats  but i m mostly interested in painting them  and i m a slow painter and don t spend as much on the hobby as they do    i want to get back into bjj or maybe muay thai  but i m to broke to afford that and a gym membership right now  the gym membership is cheaper  but the customer base there is older and i haven t met anyone through there  i ve also gained about   kg from   years of quite bad physical health  while i am working out regulalry      a week depending   i m struggling to regulate calories and that s why i m not losing weight    i am still in university    years in to a three year degree  thanks  undiagnosed adhd   i have made friends in different courses before  but they tend to fizzle our after the course is over  i make an effort to extend the friendships outside by organising times to get lunch  but it s always me who does the organising i ve found  none of them have lasted more than six months or so   in all honesty  it s so much easier to meet and sleep with women than it is to make friendships with men  that s been my experience anyway  maybe it s just the kind of personality i have    i think as well i can inadvertently be too keen  adhd does make you enthusiastic and curious  and sometimes i think i can be a bit much  i think i can make people feel like they re being interviewed  i don t mean to do it  i just don t know how else i m supposed to go about figuring them out  an older friend with adhd has told me that often people with adhd just move to quickly for others  i guess that may be what happens   i m not socially retarded anymore  i definitely was when i was younger  but i can be quite popular in my work circles  depending on the place i worked at   the place i work at now is populated by older people who are dull  i m interviewing for another role now  so hopefully that ll put me back around other people my age   i ve always struggled to make an maintain friendships though  i m really good at meeting people  just not at extending the friendships  i don t really get invited to parties anymore  i don t know anyone who hosts them to be fair   i used to really be into weed and ecstasy  i don t do either anymore because they make me more anxious than i like to be  sometimes it can be hard to find people who i relate to because of that   they just aren t that interesting to me  and then the ones who dp drugs who i find interesting make me anxious because i don t like to do drugs anymore  it s tricky    i also just plain struggle to trust people  my best friend from high school turned out to be a massive narcissist and fucked with my head a lot  another friend of mine who was older manipulated me and fucked with my head   to the point where there were times i feared for my safety  i understand not everyone is bad  but my radar for bad people may be a bit over zealous    friendships with women are more what i ve had  emotional turn taking  lots of talking and back and forth  more just hanging out  as i got older i realised that in most cases  i was actually wanting to sleep with that girl and not being honest about it  now i do have the good friendships with women  but they re sexual relationships     of the time  i am currently in a monogamous relationship   i m bringing that up because   well i don t really understand how to have ongoing friendships with men  it seems to be about activities  it s not just about hanging out and talking shit  drugs seem to be a big factor  even if we re just talking about booze     the guys who i am closer friends with are super open  they are the ones who i have long talks with and who i just hang out and eat a good meal with  i don t find many dudes who are like that though  maybe i need to look for a different kind of friendship with men   this is a ramble  i just wanted to write something out  my question is how do you go about turning acquaintances into friends  and how do you then turn those friendships into deeper

0,when can a girl act  too much like a guy   my male to female friend ratio is about   to    ive always gotten along more with boys  and men  for that matter  than women and girls  i always chalked it up to the fact i have more in common with  stereotypical boy  things  cars  video games  i have an entire collection of consoles and games   porn  money    etc  in translation i just levitated towards these things growing up and currently  make up and nails dont interest me either  i only wear makeup for special occasions and such  im also significantly less emotional than most women that even my therapist picked up on it and so have my male friends  and i think logically and often have the level head in the group when everyone else is panicking or arguing    however  im also starting to wonder if these traits are also my downfall    now  im not about rant about anything i really just want some male advice because im not a guy  but i have noticed that although all of my male friends have easily became my friend and latched on to me i started learning that they initially had crushes on me  it makes sense  but then as i talk to them and started asking why they never said anything i get the weirdest answers  one of my friends said that they thought they didnt have a chance and id be angry at them  another said that i didnt look interested in really anybody  therefore he would be wasting his breath  another said that i was more like a legitimate homie than an opportunity to date the more we got to know each other  and one said he friendzoned himself because  we got along so well that he realized that he would have no one to argue with   this one got me   other answers ive gotten are the typical ones  too scared  thought id stop being friends with them  etc    my   closest male friends  the ones i hang out with one on one  take me to dinner  get me gifts  tell me about their personal lives and i actually show affection to  that everyone said i shouldve dated  i havent dated because of specific reasons  one is gay   m and i helped him figure out he was gay  one ive known since we were in the  th grade   m and were not each others type  and one is   years my senior   m and we know it would be short term because we have different goals  however i explained to them my issue im running into and they all said that there isnt anything wrong with me  literally  the   m said i was just too young   however the   m said i might be coming off more as a homie than a potential girlfriend and i should start acting more feminine  i thought he was crazy  i dont dress like a guy  and i clearly look like a female  plus i was wondering if his version of female was the stereotype which made me feel a bit uncomfortable    ive also had a boyfriend  but i was acting completely different than i actually was so he would be be satisfied  once i started showing who i truly was  from the fact i didnt want kids or settle down  cutting my hair  and my major was economics  he was repulsed  we didnt last long after that  even though we dated for   years  i didnt know what was wrong with him  and i thought he just wanted someone submissive    but as i look around    it seems like these guys are kind of intimidated at me or i give off a wrong vibe  am i really not feminine enough   i also dont go out of my way to show interest  its just not my style  i really just perfer you tell me if you are and ill tell you how i feel and if itll work or not  im not about to make a scene about it or anything    a proposal  sure    just asking me out on a date  no     is there any advice on this  i mean i dont plan on changing who i am for male attention at all  and i am only    so i have decades to actually find someone who actually fits me  im just wondering if being  too much like a guy  can be an issue  ,0.9684,734

0,my fellow men  are jeans and casual pants  or any pants needing belt  super uncomfortable in the crotch and belly when you are sitting down  it seems that every other man are totally fine with wearing jeans all day  i dont know how they do it  but i just dont believe that im the only one who experiences discomfort with jeans  hear me out   first of all  i by no means have a big member or a big belly im just a lean guy        kg or     pounds     however  whenever im wearing jeans  casual pants  or any pants that require a belt  sitting down is always extremely uncomfortable in the crotch area because of the lack of room  and also around my belly because the belt doesnt allow any room for expansion   just for clarification  when i say  belly   im referring to the area about    under the belly button and just above the genitals  where the intestines are  the area is also in between your two pelvic bones  i understand that thats probably not called belly  but i dont know what it is called  lower abdomen    when you sit  you would require more room around your belly because of the bent angle of the torso   think about how if you crouch wearing jeans  people could see parts of your underwear from the back   when you are wearing jeans or any pants with a belt  the belt will not expand because its not elastic  so it becomes really tight around the front of the belly and therefore creates discomfort  so much so that i sometimes worry whether or not things are even moving properly in the intestines  i hope this makes sense  its admittedly hard to describe   similarly  when you sit  there is less room in the crotch area because of the bent torso  and therefore the pants are literally just right up against the genitals  it becomes even more uncomfortable if theres a boner  im sure all of you are familiar with the struggle of random boners    with dress pants  its not as bad because they usually have more room in the crotch but they are still not comfortable when sitting down because they require a belt   every day  when i take off my jeans and change into pajamas after getting home from work  its always such a huge relief    i have seen men wearing jeans at home when lounging around and i just dont know how they do that  do you feel any sort of discomfort with jeans at all  if so  do you have any solution to it  ,-0.9345,429

0,does affection deprivation as child lead to over excitedness as an adult     i have a problem  im a    year old man and i get an uncontrollable erection whenever a girl touches my arms  holds my hand  lays sits on me or even stares deeply into my eyes in conversion   initially  i thought it just happened because of puberty but it has not remotely slowed down and it is starting to affect my life because i still havent had my first kiss  i dont have a problem attracting women  usually they will approach me at social events  bars parties clubs etc   unfortunately after    minutes of talking  if theyre interested in me  my  issue  will kick in which makes me immediately self conscious and i start slouching to cover it up or outright trying to find abrupt ways to get away from the woman  usually really weird or rude  because thats the only way to stop it and also because im embarrassed feel like a creep  its frustrating especially when im talking to women i really like  its not even sexual most of the time it feels like whenever my head gets the signal that a woman is comfortable with me it mixes up the signals and calls for a full erection  i tried not masturbating for a few months and it was effective but its not sustainable as once i go back the problem returns  i was wondering if my past of rarely being touched shown affection as a child had a part to play in this   when i was a kid i wasnt really hugged fully embraced by either of my parents  they werent abusive or anything  just strict eastern parents who didnt display physical verbal affection but showed their love with actions  buying me things  cooking my fav foods   as they grew older and had my younger siblings  im the oldest  they learned to express physical verbal affection better  they would regularly hug my siblings and the few times they tried with me it felt awkward due to our relationship so they quickly stopped   i should mention here that all my younger siblings have all had their first kisses and been in relationships   i was also a really unattractive kid  skinny  poor hygiene and no fashion sense  with no social skills and no interesting qualities from primary school through to high school  due to this  no girl had a crush on me through all of school and as a result i never had any romantic interactions with the opposite sex  no first kiss  didnt even have anyone hold my hand until college   i would get the occasional hug from female friends but those slowed down stopped altogether when they realized how uncomfortable my hugs were  no joke i didnt know how to embrace people properly  still dont really     in the last four years  i have been accepted into to the most prestigious program at my school  got into exceptional shape through a rigorous gym schedule  built a sub par fashion sense and developed great social skills through many jobs extracurriculars  this was when the women started to gravitate towards me but  as i said earlier  due to my  issue  i usually have to cut interactions short before anything can happen   am i just a pervert or this there something at play psychologically   tl dr  any semi intimate touch from a women or even deep eye contact gives me an uncontrollable erection which always freaks me out so i start to act weird and look for ways to cut conversions short  usually abrupt rude way   because of this im    and have never kissed a woman despite being able to attract women to me  im wondering if im just a creep or if this is a result of me being mostly deprived of affection and interest for the first    years of my life  ,0.9819,642

0,immense guilt after breakup with needy girlfriend i am devastated with guilt  it has been   months and i still wonder why wasn t my love enough to make her feel needed  why wasn t i enough for her as a person   it started out great but after a while  i kept being subjected to small tests which increased in frequency such as            asking me if i would buy her a designer bag if i could afford it  i d answer her no stating my beliefs but that doesn t mean i wouldn t buy her gifts  i said i would be more inclined to buy her a handphone than a bag out of practicality but she kept asking me the question as if wanting me to change my answer            asking me which is more important  my hobbies or her  i d answer that if we loved each other  we wouldn t make each other choose as such because we d want each other to have our own interests but if you were that unreasonable  i d answer running  she d sob stating that my answer was so sad and she d keep sobbing  when i did not entertain her sobbing  she d ask me to stop my car and she left my car expecting me to chase after her  i didn t because i wanted her to know that this was no way to behave            criticising and nitpicking on my actions  crying whenever i did something that did not please her  i felt that if my actions could make her miserable  why am i staying in the relationship   o        asking me why i wouldn t ask her about her day each and every day  i wasn t brought up to ask such questions and as such  naturally  i wouldn t ask such questions  i felt inadequate and broken for not being able to function as she desired            accusing me of things i did not do such as shouting at her or forcing her to stay at my house  it made me question all the times that she came over to my house at first as if i pressured her but i did not have such intentions  she accused me of shouting at her out of the blue which surprised me   i grew tired of the constant and consistent actions such as above that i broke up with her  she s now feeling i neglected her and abandoned her  truthfully  we both cycled through the four horsemen of relationships  she started with criticism which made me defensive and avoidant  her criticism evolved to contempt while my defensiveness led to stonewalling to protect myself from hurt   it hurts she thinks i abused her through neglect when i broke up because i felt whatever i did and whoever i was would never meet her expectations  it got to a point that i believed her that  i did not love her as much as she loved me   i felt like i was a monster who did not appreciate love in front of me   it was only after     months after the break up that i saw the relationship more objectively and read up on  controlling and needy relationships  which sounded like my ex a lot  i went out of my way wanting to tell her about this findings on my end but she wouldn t listen  i wanted to work her through this now that i have this newfound information   however she wants nothing to do with me and said that i am selfish for contacting her after breaking up  going as far as stating i am stalking her by trying to communicate with her after our break up  i d go as far as saying she s been cruel to me in our communications in spite of me just wanting to discuss our break up for us to heal   full disclosure  i begged her for forgiveness in the past when i was so filled with guilt and sadness that i was the author of her pain  with a more objective lens now  i no longer feel the need to reach out to her   any thoughts or advice   tl dr  i broke up with a needy ex girlfriend  we no longer contact each other but i feel guilt for not being able to save her from her condition as i love her a lot  she hates me and thinks i am an asshole  advice to overcome this guilt  ,-0.9984,743

0,developing an  entourage  social circle  amp  life     first of all i apologize for the long post  but i really put my whole heart  amp  effort into this  its really something that i care about and would appreciate a lot if someone relates and could share their insight and experiences     i find myself thinking  and struggling  a lot about this   think  entourage  the movie  im sure every man watches that and sees it as goals   now  im not talking about the stuff in it which might be unrealistic  surely not everybody gets to fly a helicopter onto a yacht  partying with supermodels every casual saturday afternoon  but thinking within that theme  its about having a solid group of people around you who are at least somewhat connected  fun  and get to do cool things with  not just grab a beer on the weekend and crash on the couch later  basically living a fulfilling life  within ones means capabilities   i dont know if many people would even relate to this  but i think for those who live in big cities  im sure you know what im trying to say and also aspire for that  cities like london  new york  monte carlo  dubai  etc  you have all the nightlife  sometimes even things like that requiring connections to get into  e g  zuma in london   and whatnot  i was at a similar restaurant the other day and saw a guy at the other table which fit this entourage example       he was dressed sharp  displaying fun cool vibes  and sitting on a table with a bunch of other like minded guys  and of course beautiful girls  i immediately started thinking to myself how i could just be at that table  what does it take to get your foot into that kinda scene   surely one would immediately think  oh well he has money  duh  you just need money   but thats not entirely true  theres only so much money and people in this world  not everyone walking around rich   surely he was rich  nightlife connoisseur   but im sure theres even people richer than him there who are just spending a  boring  night out with less vibrant company  different lifestyle  and the other thing is  even for people like him who are rich  youre not necessarily going to always be around people on the same level as you  i know another guy who is in a similar situation  he is rich indeed  but has many of his friends who arent nearly as well off  and theyd tag along to nearly all of the activities  now of course those friends of his arent just in a different dimension  they do alright and arent just leaching off of him  nobody would want or tolerate that  but for example even though he might have a huge house  throw fun parties there  supercars and travel all the time  his friends might have a fraction of that  but still something decent   and get to come to the same parties  experience the same lifestyle and whatnot     thats  what im referring to   how do you get into that kind of scene   for someone who lets say has some of the means  but not the right cards  for example  i have seen from personal experience that people who attended certain schools  you get to be in a certain environment and around a certain demographic  and it makes it    x easier to just  fall into  that kind of setting  again  not necessarily about wealth  i have been to and experienced wealthy educational institutions and some of them are completely dull and mundane  nothing like what im describing    so for the other group who wasnt so lucky in that regard  which i find myself in   how would you go about finding such a social circle  and getting to enjoy those kind of things  that is  fun guys with cool vibes into the nightlife  travels  exuding all that positive energy and attracting similar people and attractive girls  here are some of the approaches ive took which were great  but didnt quite find much  lasting  success   first of all i did all the basics  amp  prerequisites of almost a decade long investment  such as lifting weights  getting fit  personal development to overcome obstacles  amp  develop skills  grooming style fashion  etc    and then i started going out to those places which i like  and where those people i described would ultimately be at  i was going to enjoy myself first  amp  foremost  but i wouldnt be enjoying too much  especially considering that the fun in it is going with company  but nonetheless i did  and put myself out there  but it was quite difficult to build anything out of it  maybe more so for someone whos somewhat of an introvert like myself    the other day i was at a beach club  very popular local place  and attracts many people who come there dressed well  looking fun  cool vibes and whatnot  often celebrities  not very poplar though   and lots of rapper like people  but completely classy  on the contrary   so i was sitting on a single sunbed  and i went dressed in my favourite clothes and wore my favourite watch  basically like something that fits the dress code and vibe  although there isnt one actually     i notice a guy in front of me wearing a similar type of watch  but much nicer one   and so i admired it from a close distance and then kept going about my day  a few minutes later he goes somewhere  and when he comes back  i hear someone coming at me from behind with a super cool vibe and complementing my watch  like  heeeey nice watch  and extends his arm for a fist bump  i reciprocated that same energy  but much more relaxed  im introverted  and complimented his  not much a conversation but just a   second type of interaction  he proceeded to go to his seat in front of me  where he was with his guy friend  about    minutes later  i decide to be more of an extrovert  like ive been promising myself to   and so i go and take a dip in the pool  then as im coming out i approach him and ask him if hes from the city  turns out he was visiting   and whether hed like to get a bigger table and invite some girls over  he said he was interested but had to leave quite soon  so suggested another time  i felt he was reaching for his phone to keep in touch with me  but me being an introvert who hates feeling intrusive and felt quite intimidated by that rejection  i kinda just subtly ended the conversation and left  i found out later he was a professional  non famous  soccer player  randomly through instagram location geotag of that place we were at   and his vibe was so cool basically fit  tatted  jewellery and outgoing and whatnot  dancing and chilling  basically     similar to this guy https  imgur com a yrfdmhq   he and his friend brought   russian girls to their sunbed a while later before leaving them behind  like he said   but they bounced contact info i noticed  and i felt super bummed i was like a loser basically  although i did try to approach girls during the time there  as i was looking to get a bigger nicer spot and party  but i just had some small talk with   friends  and didnt manage to gather a decent crowd   now anyway  ive went a dozen times there before  and even more times to other places  but rarely ran into a situation like this  the only other time was that a girl saw me at a more relaxed place  and decided to message me on instagram when she somehow found my page   so i definitely notice that putting myself out there is opening up some opportunities  although rarely   but even then its not leading to much   and not to mention  i feel like thats      because of me   im not even in a situation to attract that  like thinking of the thought of me just being there solo  no matter how cool or well dressed  not really providing much value  i feel like i need an actual social circle  so that not only would i be able to smoothly approach others  both guys  amp  girls  for friendships connections relationships fun  but also enjoy myself more in the process  and more importantly be myself  and more relaxed  and ultimately provide value so that people would want to come along  and whatnot    thoughts  ,0.9999,1416

0,boyfriend cums way too quickly    whats causing this  some background  we have been dating about two months  the first time we had sex  he came in about two minutes  he was visibly embarrassed and we laughed it off together  the second time  he came even quicker  he was again embarrassed and said he wasnt sure what was going on  he said he just found me very attractive and it was making him cum really quick  well  fast forward to now  two months later    hes never lasted longer than two minutes in bed  if i give him even a hand job or a blow job he cums extremely fast  one time  i was touching his penis through his pants while we were watching tv  i start kissing him  i took off my shirt and bra and then start to pull his penis out and touch it directly  not even a hand job at that point  just touching it   he then cums right there on his pants    heres my question  what the heck is causing this  from what hes told me  this has never been such an issue as it is now  unless hes flat out lying which i dont think he is   i do get the hunch that hes perhaps been a fast cummer in the past  but it seems that whats happening now    literally cumming in his pants    is unusual for him  is it really just that im  that  attractive as he claims  if that was the case  wouldnt it make sense that hed gradually be able to last longer as the  newness  wore off    so one part of this    im pretty kinky and experimental in bed and hes generally been a plain vanilla kind of guy historically  basic foreplay followed by missionary   so im hoping part of it may be just all the  new stuff  im doing with him and that novelty will wear off  im also about    years younger and maybe thats part of the  hotness  to him  i guess my fear is that this is not going to go away which would stink because i really like him  ive never been able to get off with him and i cant imagine being in a relationship where i never really get to enjoy sex  i know that he can get me off via foreplay before  but i really do like the actual penetration too  so just wondering does this sound like a medical issue  or just a  new relationship excitement  issue  ,0.985,413

0,any young men    s   s  experience problems with maintaining your erection  im really struggling with maintaining an erection before and during sex  it has been like this my the whole time i have been sexually active  including with my ex girlfriend      year relationship  and now my current girlfriend  i have no troubles maintaining an erection if i am pleasuring myself  getting oral handjob  but it seems i cant keep it erect for long enough during sex  i have to constantly have some form of stimulation to keep it up  which is bothersome because that isnt usually how sex is  i have never came from sex  and the times where i could keep it hard enough for awhile     minutes  i didnt really get anywhere and eventually it went limp  on to my current girlfriend  we tried sex the other day  and i couldnt even get it erect enough to put it in  however  i was rock hard during kissing and when she finished me with a handjob  also  i frequently wake up with erections  which by far last the longest lasting erections for me   thus  i am leaning towards thinking that this is not related to a physical cause  although my current girlfriend is understanding  it is really frustrating to not be able to perform  furthermore  i told her i got nervous and thats why it didnt happen   in terms of my health  i got my blood work done for a separate health issue and everything seems to have been normal  even though i feel really shitty at times  i exercise   days a week  including playing soccer twice a week and go to the gym   times a week  i would say i am in pretty good shape  i e   cardio is good  good build   i recently started taking vitamin d and vitamin b    just as some additional supplements as i heard that help with hormone production  im thinking my issue is probably related to masturbating too much  right now  im masturbating around     times per day  the only reason why i am not entirely convinced is that i have cut it back for awhile  and it seems to have not made a significant difference   although i am looking for longer term solutions  what would be something that could help me in the short term  i dont want to upset my girlfriend again by being unable to have sex  i have heard about horny goat weed  tribulus and a few other things  but i wanted your take  im not open to trying cialis or anything like that because im genuinely worried i might have some complications from taking it  any help would be awesome  ,0.9783,441

0,is this girl still interested in me  well shit    im not sure whether this is the right thing to do but fuck it help me out  guys   lately  ive been confused about this girl im    and shes     weve both been friends for a long time  there was never anything romantic between us in the beginning  however  around december       i started joking with her about how i wanted to cuff her and date her at first it was a joke and we both talked about it and agreed upon having a thing together and decided to go on date  which to my surprise was not awkward one bit it actually felt natural i held her hand  she laid on my chest during the movie and we talked and were having a great time  after this date  we started talking more and went on more dates together  before i knew it i started catching feelings for and we started sending each other cute messages and we spent valentines together where i made my move to kiss her and all i gotta say wow she was blushing and i just felt so happy but eventually around february my dumbass decided to ask her what we were she proceeded telling me that we were a thing but we were kinda dating but without the title meaning  we couldnt be talking to other people  i should mention that before any of this happened  she had recently gotten out of a toxic relationship   well after this conversation things between me and her started going bad and i decided to end it with her before one of us really got hurt which was the biggest mistake of my life cause  in the end  i ended up hurting my own self and im pretty sure i ended up hurting her feelings    after this  i realized that i made the biggest mistake and i tried fixing things with her but unfortunately she didnt want to open up to me again  i spent the entire      year being depressed and honestly  i dont know about you guys but      was such an ass of a year  i spent most of the year unable to sleep because i couldnt get her out of my mind and what made it worse is that while i was out visiting family in guatemala i came back and found out that my friend had done something with her but im not even sure what happened cause at first he told me that did stuff with her which really broke me but i couldnt believe him because shes not the type of girls who give it up that easily  in fact  she told me that she wanted to wait till marriage and that why she broke up with a lot of her boyfriends cause they all just wanted to fuck her  me and my friend fought and he finally ended up telling me that he was joking and they didnt do anything he just kissed her for a few seconds causes she was like nahh im not easy like that   bruhh honestly as im writing this im not even sure what i want   well as the year went by the pain slowly went away and i started enjoying being single again and honestly  ive finally reached a point in my life where im happy by myself and have reached a point where i know that i deserve better than her  but recently my friend convinced me to start texting her again since its the new year      and we havent talked much but honestly  i dont really feel it anymore with her but there is a tiny part of me that wants to try again even tho i know that im not vibing with her like i used to  first of all  i cant really tell whether she is interested i think she may be but its hard to tell by the way she texts  she a person that is dry texter and she has always been like this from the beginning even when we had our thing together  also  its not so easy to hang out with her cause she recently has entered school again and she plays in the soccer team which means she gets home late and having hispanic parents makes it even way more difficult for me to hang out with her cause they dont allow me to be out late and fuck the weekends are also hard cause she serves at my church so and on saturdays  i work with my dad  also  im soon gonna start school which sucks cause im gonna be coming home late since all my classes end around   or   pm  the only thing that makes me think that she is interested is that she sometimes uses smiling emojis with her texts  for example when she says goodnight she usually sends it like this  goodnight     or  goodmorning      bruhh honestly i dont even know if i even like her at this point or whether she likes me so can yall do your thing and help me out  ,0.9962,846

0,how to know if im about to make the worst mistake of my life by breaking up  or if it would be beneficial to my current girlfriend and i  oddly specific advice requested    hey guys  sorry for the click bait ish title  i struggled with what to call it for a while before submitting this  mods  if this is outta line  let me know and ill try to title it some other way    i come to you all seeking advice for a rather specific situation  one that has kept me up at night for weeks and has bothered me quite a bit    to start  ive soon to be    been seeing my current girlfriend soon to be    for about six months  shes fantastic  super attractive  insanely sweet  a pleasure to have around  does random acts of kindness for me all the time etc etc    we have a super healthy relationship  no fighting  no jealousy  no insecurities  and she gets along with friends and family very well  but ive never really felt that intensive emotional chemistry connection with her that many people say exists when youre  in love  or like i have experienced for others in the past  i like her  i like being around her  but i dont get butterflies when i go to answer the door and i dont daydream about her all day like i have with previous significant others  in fact  i sometimes find myself daydreaming about the single life  or thinking of other girls  one of the ones that got away recently came back around and asked me out  and it got me fantasizing about what could have been where ordinarily  if i was  in love   id just ignore it  but thats a story for another time  on paper this may seem like a pretty cut and dry case but     the overarching catch is  my mother has cancer  it was originally stage   breast cancer in       but through intensive chemo and multiple surgeries she survived in remission until around      when it came back with a vengeance  its now all over her body  and these truly will be her final months  im one of those guys that buries emotions internally  and ive certainly done that here  ive tried to carry on as if nothing was wrong for the past few years while enjoying the single life and not really worrying about the inevitable that my family now faces  this sounds like i dont spend any time with my mom but trust me  i do  im there several times per week hanging out with her   my mothers increased fragility of late has certainly taken its toll on me  and weighs on my subconscious im sure as much as it does my conscious mind  so i think theres absolutely no doubt that this is causing me problems in  falling for  this current girlfriend or getting to where i may be should be feelings wise at this point in the relationship    so the additional struggle is what to do here  the girlfriend is absolutely wife material on paper  shes got everything id want in a significant other    on paper  ive been in long term relationships before where i felt it  and ive been in the short term whirlwind infatuation things that end just as fast as they start  see other girl above that popped up to ask me out recently  too  ive felt  something   im just not feeling that  love  feeling that i want to feel for someone for this girl right at this moment  come to think of it  i never really had that infatuation period with her  but i kept figuring it would come and i enjoyed her company enough that i kept waiting it out  i think this all is partially due to my emotions being tied up elsewhere  obviously  but thats only going to get worse considering the inevitable  i think    i fear that if i end it now  ill be writing this all again in the  guys  whos the one you regret that got away   posts of next year  i dont want that regret to eat away at my mind  i also do not want to waste this great girls time while im emotionally unavailable to an extent  like i said  i like her  i just cant seem to fall for her as much as i want to be able to    i thought that writing all this out may show my bias as to one decision or the other  but honestly i still feel like this reads as me being on the fence  should i just bring this up to her  without putting a break up on the table and just see how the conversation plays out  should i tough it out and hope that one day it magically falls into place for me  should i ask her for a  break   as cliche as that sounds  to work on myself through this time    ive asked plenty of friends i trust  including my mother  and the opinions are all over the spectrum  im considering that maybe an unbiased crowd could help me see the light here  thanks in advance to those who took the time to even read this  i appreciate you  ,0.9984,864

0,how to understand why ive been blocked  this message is   not   about wanting to get back with him or message him again  i definitely don t desire anything from him anymore   i am seeking insight on why he would block me where i went wrong    so i live in the uk and he lives in the us  we started talking online after he dmed me  instagram  whatsapp and we also did video calls   when we first started talking i respectfully told him my concerns which were that we lived in two different countries  we decided to keep it casual and that we would just be internet friends lol  anyways we kept talking for a few months and feelings developed on both sides  it got to the point where we would video call call each other and speak about the future and how if we could actually be together  before you know it we had both exchanged  i love you s   he would always share pictures and videos of what he was doing  he would want to chat on the phone and just say really romantic things and even send songs he had recorded and poems   anyways within the last few weeks he has become really weird  whilst he always replies to my messages when he is online  his replies can sometimes mean that i have to work hard to keep the conversation going  that s not to say that he gives me one word answers but just really simple replies  now  to be fair he never ignored my messages or failed to reply  plus he did initiate conversations   i thought that the issue was that we were communicating via text and a lot of meaning can be lost  so i asked if we could videocall talk on the phone and he was kind of blas  about it all saying he was busy with work  which i understand  as he works really long hours         however  my issue was that he didn t want to schedule it for a day that he was off  i didn t tell him this though    anyways eventually i couldn t deal with being the one to primarily keep a conversation  i was getting confused as it felt like he didn t want to speak to me but would reply to my messages  eventually i voiced my concerns to him and he said that maybe we should just stay friends and not pursue anything romantic  eventually he replied and said it had taken a long time to reply  though he was online  because he was upset that i had tried to break it off  he said that he loved me and wanted to keep talking  i had feelings for him as well and decided to keep talking to him   however things didn t really change  and he still seemed distant  so  yesterday i sent him another message saying something like  hey i hope you re okay  you seem a little distant and it kind of hard talking to someone who gives me the vibe that they aren t really interested anymore  i really do understand if that is the case as we do live in other countries  just let me know you know   anyways he replied by saying that i was over thinking and that he didn t really know what to say  i responded by saying that he just seemed a little distant and not as expressive as he once was  afterwards he ignored my messages though he was online quite a bit during the day  towards the end of the day i asked him   are you gonna reply     to which he didn t   anyways  i woke up this morning and found that he had blocked me on whatsapp and instagram  i m in shock because i just don t understand why he wouldn t just say i m not interested  i m not the fiery type and i would have accepted it and respected his decision because we do live so far apart  it just sucks because i was really looking forward to showing him around the uk and doing all the plans we had made    sorry for the long post but i m confused  please give me insight on why you think he acted like this and whether i was wrong to tell him that he seemed distant    a friend said that maybe i came off as demanding by asking him if anything was up   thank you  ,0.9913,743

0,how to overcome a major failure and start from scratch  hi i write to you guys to ask for advice  so i failed  i failed big time  i was studying engineering at the top university in my country and i was in my  nd year of studies  this university is notorious for its academic difficulty which i came to accept in my first year  due to a rough upbringing i ve always been a depressed and anxious kid since i could remember  come  nd year my depression got so bad that i started having panic attacks and used to be so sad that i couldn t focus on studying  long story short i failed that semester  the university gave me another chance and i was allowed to repeat the semester  i took the time in between my repeat semester to self reflect and mentally heal my self from my past  i became mentally tougher and made huge progress in getting rid of the demons that have haunted me and getting involved in other life projects   now come my repeat semester  everything was going smooth until my midterms came along  somehow the past crept back up and hindered my performance so much that i completely bombed  one of the six exams i had  i told myself no worries the other ones went fine keep and if i keep working hard ill just need a    on the final exam to pass that course  so thats what i did i gave it my all like always and long story short i got below    on the exam and failed horribly  which brought my average down to the point that i failed my repeat semester and will be kicked out of the engineering department in my school with no chance to get back in and the only place i can apply back to in that university is the arts program   looking back i realize that i wasn t smart enough for the program at that specific university because i gave it my all and still performed horribly  but looking back in the grand scheme of things i also realize that though ive always given my best effort  ive never been able to live up to my potential because of my mental state  which fills me with deep regret because it makes me think if only i was wiser or had better guidance at a younger age and had fixed my mental state earlier that perhaps i could ve reached my potential and been better focused while studying and excelled  also seeing as my friends in the same program at less difficult universities excelling makes me deeply regret my choice to go to my current university   looking at all my other friends excelling and almost about to get their degrees while im left with no where to go having to start from scratch really hurts  i ve always tried my best and most times fell short but this time i ve fell so hard that i ve closed the doors to opportunities that i ve desired my whole life    now i have to in essence start from scratch with   years of debt and   years of time wasted  i still want to go on and have a successful life  which is why the advice that i ask for is how do i mentally overcome such a failure in life and move on and not fall back into the depression that has always hindered me in my past  ,0.6386,580

0,when should you advance   make a move  on a girl  hey everyone  im sure this type of post is common on here  ive looked through this subreddit and even found a few similar posts with corresponding answers  most of the time  men on here are saying its never to early to make a move and some say its better to advance early on  i understand where this is coming from because you dont want to waste your time with a girl that doesnt reciprocate attraction  but i dont want to come off as impulse and possibly desperate   i think context is very important here  ive entered my second semester of college last week and have tried my luck with talking to women during class  so far  ive only connected with this one girl  lets call her chelsea  from my chem lecture  unlike the other girls who showed disinterest and prompted one way conversations  she actually adds to the conversation and cracks jokes back with me    weve only talked three time so far i only have lecture mwf   but i think she likes me  she was quick to give our her number and added me through snap right after we said goodbye  now  she might just be nice  but she offered that we study together when exams finally roll around  now  i never dated a girl before because i had been obese for most of my life  i lost over   lbs this past year  started dressing grooming well and have just tried talking to women  so  i dont really know what to expect    are there any  hints  that i could drop to see if she likes me back   im afraid that shell freindzone me and i dont really think friendships really recover from that  i feel like itll always be awkward afterward  im saying this because ive only met   female freinds since starting college     of friends are males  so im literally betting everything haha   how do you guys feel about all this    tldr  made freinds with a girl recently  but want to advance into dating her  when would be a good time to prompt this without sounding desperate and thirsty  ,0.9773,359

0,could you help a man beating a brain tumor  first sergeant marnix      would certainly die  but now there is hope again   amp  x   b   first  marnix landman       a fit  strong former army sergeant  would die from a brain tumor   the doctors were pretty sure   but then the young father from arnhem came across an experimental  expensive medicine in america   and suddenly he feels it again  hope   in fact  marnix was not going to give an interview   not because he cant tell about his story   on the contrary  hes quite an easy talker   but he just doesnt like attention  and what he doesnt like at all  ask for help  that is not for him   he wants to do it himself  solve it yourself  like he always did   but now he has to  now that death is lurking  he has nothing to lose anymore  so now he asks  help    amp  x   b   tough guy   amp  x   b   marnix is   such a fit  tough guy   he was a military officer  even a sergeant  and was always at the forefront of sports lessons   he was not afraid of anyone  not for the taliban either   when he heard in      that dutch soldiers would be sent to afghanistan  he knew  i want to come  he went with him   in      marnix started to lose condition  he was often dizzy   especially when he drank alcohol at parties    sometimes i had to spit after one glass     amp  x   b    amp  x   b   medical mill   amp  x   b   a few times  his wife priscilla      had said   go see the doctor   so marnix visited the doctor   in retrospect  that was the first step towards a long  very long medical mill   he went to the cardiologist  he couldnt find anything  he went to the ent doctor  he couldnt find anything   only when the neurologist looked   something  was seen  but still marnix thought  not too bad   he went to the hospital on his own for the results   i thought  im going there just as quickly   priscilla wanted to come along  but i had said that morning  oh dear  stay at home     then it started  in that consultation room  marnix was told the terms  cancer    tumor   and  brain stem    the doctors said there was nothing they could do  but there would be follow up examinations   perhaps the tumor grew very slowly  or was benign   marnix drove back home with lead in his shoes and entered his living room   priscilla was mopping   she remembers well   he came in and he cried   she says    well  and then the misery really started    while priscilla and marnix tell their story  they are sitting in the living room in their terraced house in arnhem   priscilla pours tea and sits in the chair  on the couch  marnix and marnix junior  their   year old son   he eats chips and plays a game on the ipad  occasionally a sound comes out of his mouth  a cheeky laugh  or a cry    i want to see him grow up   says marnix   i want to teach him norms and values  i want to tell him the things he needs to know   i want to read stories  comfort him when he is scared  i want to see him go to school      amp  x   b    amp  x   b   rare   amp  x   b   marnix appeared to have a malignant  aggressive tumor  a rare one  too   the tumor remained calm for two years  but in      it started to grow   the tumor affected marnixs balance organ  he got worse  he got double vision    i was always so fit  a strong soldier  i played a lot  was really such an outsider  and now i cant even walk the dog anymore    to see if the tumor could be partially removed  marnix was operated on   he points to the back of his head  a vertical line  from top to bottom    but the cancer was too close to the part of the brain that regulates our breathing  and blood pressure   they could take a biops the size of a pen tip and that was it      amp  x   b   pregnant   amp  x   b   marnix also received irradiations  forty times in total  including six weeks in germany   priscilla also became pregnant at the time  or have they considered not doing it  taking a child  they talked about it   but their desire for children was so great   priscilla also underwent ivf attempts and they were already working before marnix fell ill   moreover  the doctors had said that if he were lucky  marnix could live like that for another twenty or thirty years    we wanted to live our lives     amp  x   b   roughly upset   amp  x   b   last year there were plans for a second child  but they were disturbed roughly   marnix makes the sound of a blast  because thats how it went in his head  an explosion of malice took place in his head   the tumor had grown again   all doctors said the same thing  i wouldnt survive this    his complaints got worse  walking was more difficult and the tumor made him deaf in one ear    as if im constantly standing next to a jet fighter taking off  i hear that   and marnix   military  so   can know what that sounds like    amp  x   b   anxious   amp  x   b   and then that tough  strong marnix was afraid of something for the first time in his life  unsure about something   for the future of his son and his wife  and his parents and sister and brother   how should they proceed   when i die  the light goes out on me  i dont feel anything anymore  i cant think anymore   but they    marnix points to his wife and child    they must go further  without me    it often leaves priscilla  especially in the middle of the night in bed  staring at the ceiling in panic   he is my basis   when i met him ten years ago  i knew  this boy is wonderful and will take very good care of me all his life      amp  x   b    amp  x   b   heart warming   amp  x   b   to get more room financially  the couple tried to get the military invalidity pension through a lawyer   priscilla wrote a letter to the minister  marnix  who was diagnosed with ptsd after his deployment to afghanistan  is entitled to that money    but it has to come soon  because i dont know how long i have left    the bad result also spread quickly among friends and family   marnix mates with whom he was in the peloton  nine years ago in afghanistan  started a crowdfunding campaign   to raise money for priscilla and marnix junior  for when their father and husband would no longer be there   they raised a few thousand euros at the end of last year    wonderful   marnix calls it   heartwarming   priscilla calls it  but marnix also said  i want to remain anonymous    i am not a person in the spotlight  i dont like asking for money     amp  x   b   hope   amp  x   b   but now  now its different  completely different  marnix heard about an experimental drug in the us through  specifically focused on the type of cancer he has   he got in touch with another dutchman who was already in the process  and his results are promising   and hope  that was what marnix needed   when i heard that  then i felt it welling up    he points to his stomach   i felt a kind of zest for life again  that i thought  there is another chance   he is silent for a moment   marnix junior left a peasant   a peasant   says marnix senior  then    i am certainly realistic  i know  the drugs are not for nothing experimental  the side effects unknown   i dont know if it suits me  i know  i know  but what do i have to lose     his sister  brother and parents contacted american hospitals   they sent marnixs medical records and he was invited for an intake    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   issue   amp  x   b   the problem is that the treatments are expensive  the intake costs around        dollars   the medicines are free  because marnix is   a test subject  but if he gets sick   and that chance is high because it is a fierce medicine      then hospitalization in america costs another          to          every day    amp  x   b   that is why marnix puts his pride in him and asks for help  to everyone he knows  and everyone he doesnt know   whether they have money for him  perhaps   every euro helps  i want to fight for my family   priscilla and i want to make a dream trip  we want to go to amusement parks with marnix  we want to do fun things  we want to live   just a normal life      amp  x   b    amp  x   b   im going   amp  x   b   the costs for the intake are now covered  the day after tomorrow marnix flies to the us   to the mass general cancer hospital in boston  his father and brother are coming  because traveling alone is not possible    i fall over every minute   he pulls up his trouser leg and shows a bruise   happened this morning  in the bathroom    and flying can be risky   but i am going   says marnix  he claps his hands demonstratively   the sound is loud in the living room  as if he wants to say  and

0,can you go from being housemates friends to something more  or is this a relationship of convenience  in october last year  i  f    crossed paths with a guy i had met before  m    through my ex husband but hadn t seen for years after he went mia due to a marriage breakdown and short stint in jail  immediately we hit it off like we had known eachother forever  he was coming out of a long  difficult phase of his life that led to him becoming homeless and addicted to drugs with no access to his children and went from a successful husband father with heaps of money at his disposal to living on the streets and stealing to survive    i ve always had empathy for people who have been through this kind of adversity  and i was in a low point in my life too  with a terminally ill mother  escalating drug habit and recent separation  from the first day he came to my house  he never left  i loved having him round and i honestly feel like he is the first person who has ever really understood me  we were sleeping together from the very start  him sharing a bed in my house without me even questioning it  or asking him to contribute to rent and bills  we both admitted to being kind of averse to a traditional romantic relationship because we were both still healing  fast forward two months and we are as close as two people can be  having threesomes  and sex on the side but with nothing but respect and support for one another emotionally  this was so freeing for me   finally i felt like there really was somebody who truly  got it   love and intimacy without ownership or expectation    we decided to get a place of our own with two entirely separate living quarters to continue our  lifestyle   but soon after moving in there was no denying that it was starting to look a lot like love or traditional monogamy  after a period of week where we fought constantly about this new dynamic  i put it to him that perhaps we should give romance a go  i ve fallen head over heels in love with him  and after one night of very different sex to the usual emotionally detached shagging   passionate and vulnerable  gazing into eyes kind of shit   we just slipped quickly into openly acting like a couple  we spent christmas with eachother s families  and not long after he admitted he had fallen for me and opened up a dialogue about us having children together in the future  he told me he deleted all dating apps  which we used to peruse women together  and said he couldn t imagine being intimate with anyone else now    suddenly though  he began reverting back to the more detached sex  the sharp shift again in dynamic was like a slap in the face after i allowed myself to love him  i started worrying about how much energy he was spending trying to get some belongings back from a recent ex  yet with no progress  and came to the conclusion that one or both were dragging the process out intentionally due to them still having feelings for eachother  last night when i was under the influence  i got into an unthinkable state where i looked through his phone trying to understand their dynamic through seeing how they converse with eachother privately  i felt like he was an unreliable narrator  perhaps in denial about the true nature of things with her    i read their correspondence and it was largely him berating her in long rants for her wrongdoings in the relationship  she had assaulted him  and an equal amount of sexually degrading and dirty texts begging for her to sleep with him  to which she rarely replied or even acknowledged other than to say  we won t ever sleep together again   one of the texts he sent    minutes after he and i had been intimate    this cracked me wide open and seemed at odds with everything i knew him to be as a person  i was under the impression that it was she who was begging him to stay friends and then have sex with him as a way of rekindling the relationship    i told him that i looked at his phone and he lost it at me  became enraged and so angry that he wouldn t and or couldn t even acknowledge that despite my breach of his trust  and the new dynamic of the relationship  that his actions were in bad taste and disrespectful in the context of how he said he felt about me    he hasn t spoken to me all day other than a few heater exchanges that escalated  namely the idea that because of how hurt i was  i was prioritising my own needs above his which indicates an inherent selfishness that he feels has just become evident in me now  the more cold and heartless his is  the more  i keep trying to engage to try and connect rather than respect his request for space  which is pathetic  given that i m very aware of how irrational i m being in my need to get him to validate the way i feel  i m making myself sick    am i wasting my time and getting used  or could we actually be in love  i m starting to fear that my ability to read the play has been drastically diminished and that i ve made a diabolically bad call when it comes to this situation   a whole new delusional low    any advice at all is welcome  i m at breaking point  ,0.9475,946

0,is the grass ever greener  hi all    i m     and in a   year relationship with my best friend and a woman i love deeply  we live in a house together  she bought  with our dog and cat  our lives are pretty great and we have a healthy relationship  she s really the perfect girlfriend    so  i ll just say it   i still want to have sex with other women and i have these urges all the time  even when i m out with her at a mall  restaurants  walking around the city etc etc  i think it s usual guy urges and typically after i take care of business the feeling passes and i m happy to be with her  but i find like     of the time i m still thinking of other women   i d never cheat on her and i ve never had anything more than a thought  but three days ago i was about    minutes late to the doctor  which for me is a rare event   checked in  sat down  after a second  i went to the restroom  on my way out  i had a weird thought  like  i wish a some  something unintelligible but in a word  hot  guy would just show up   at this same time i have a sensation in my mind that can only be described as a coconut falling on my head  immediately as i get out of the bathroom  and turn to my right to get back to the waiting room  i notice a noticeably beautiful woman walking a few feet in front of me  she then quickly turns back and gasps   i think   at the very least  she makes a shocked face    she then immediately turns back around and walks a few feet further ahead into the waiting room  and honestly she almost looks slightly embarrassed  i m usually pretty bad at this  but i promise y all i definitely caught her checking me out    now  this girl is gorgeous  my first thought was this girl is so pretty my girl rn would understand why i left  i mean a real life    sick w o makeup   now i m a solid        on a good day and dating another   like we a fairly good looking couple  but i mean this girl right here  this is a women odysseus would travel for  so she sits down on the wall to our left and i sit perpendicular to her on the wall to her right  it s a fairly small waiting room  we make polite eye contact except i m sure i m smiling like charlie brown finding a golden ticket  my dumb brain is like fuck it  ww  might be happening  so i think to myself if i get the opportunity i gotta ask her out  like this is a real life lady liberty  you only get one shot  one opportunity   a moment later  a nurse calls my name  i shoot my shot  i walk up to her  say  my name is alex and i m so sorry to bug you but i have to ask   i would love to take you out sometime if you re interested    hand her my phone  she considers for a brief second and it s almost instant success  she enters her number right away  i say thank you  take care and turn to my nurse then immediately trip over the table behind me  i m embarrassed and look back   she s looking down  hopefully smiling  although i can t tell as i m super embarrassed    i go into the doctor office and never see here again  men  this is the first number i ve gotten in over five years  i love my girlfriend  she s gorgeous  fairly wealthy family  and is super chill  my life is really good and would be good with her    so i look to internet strangers for advice  are these thoughts normal  or when you re in love with someone is all you should think about is them  maybe i m never meant to enjoy love  maybe men can never be monogamous   and is the grass really greener on the other side  is it worth risking a really  really good girl for perhaps nothing  i mean for all i know it s a fake number     at this time i only have her number  haven t texted and don t even know her name  but i feel like this is a fork in the road moment in life and i m not sure what path to take  any advice or thoughts are appreciated   thank you   a ,0.9995,763

0,why are so many men so useless in defending helping others  do you have an examples of men being useful to help give me hope  throwaway account  due to this likely being super upsetting to some people  i m not intending to attack  i m just feeling very disappointed and confused  i m hoping for responses beyond  i woulda kicked that guy s ass   like  either a explanation of why men act this way or a counter example of a times you or other men have been useful when someone is being harassed  bullied  attacked  assaulted  etc   other than once or twice when the rare competent bouncer has intervened when i ve called for help  or the time a guy i knew stabbed a guy who groped his wife  which  btw  i don t condone and he took that way too far   i can think of zero times a man has helped me or someone else out in these scenarios  i can think of plenty of times when i ve watched men  even men who were paid as security  do nothing   i threw a house party at a friend s house  this guy punched his girlfriend  my dude friend sitting next to me saw but did nothing  i asked her to go to the bathroom with me and her abusive pos bf followed  a friend of the owner i guess was told to not let anyone down the hall  but i told him it was important  he watched and did nothing as this guy shoved me into a wall to get to his gf   recently  some asshole threw a drink on me  no one said shit to him  i decided i was going to fight this punk myself  he shoved a chair in my face and told me he has no issues hitting women  after i told him to take the first swing  finally the bartender stepped in  my supposed friend  a dude  said absolutely nothing through the whole ordeal  did absolutely nothing  didn t even offer to walk me home or ask me if i was okay   but as far as women  i ve had many women stand up for me  i ve gotten into my share of physical and verbal altercations with men i see fucking with women  i ve seen women sucker punch people fucking with their boyfriends and male friends  as well   yet    people tell me all the time i need a man in certain scenarios for protection  why  they tell me it s necessary  that men are bigger and so you need them    but what good is size if they don t even have the courage to  say  something  nonetheless  do  something    the safest i have ever felt was with one of my girls  who was          lbs soaking wet  she grew up on the streets and while she always avoided escalation  girl could fight   you hear of men decking some dude for touching his girlfriend    but at that point  it seems like ego  doesn t it  i d deck some dude for laying hands on anyone smaller than them  regardless of gender or relation to me   my only explanation i can rack my brain for as to why more men don t step up is that when it s a physical altercation between two men  it is different than one between a man and a woman and escalate farther  but i don t even see guys stepping up to say  hey  man  that s not okay  or ask someone who s being assaulted or bullied if they re okay  i ve had women  and a few enby trans folks  i ve never met before come up to me to ask me if i m okay  a dude kicked me at a party  not hard but wouldn t stop  kicking me and it really upset me  and this awesome enby person followed me into the bathroom to be with me and try to help mediate  zero cis dudes there did that   i can go on and on but i think y all get the point  i see men on tv in the news doing awesome  courageous shit to help others  i hear about it online  but pretty much all men i ve met are useless when it comes to stepping in to stop bullying  assault  etc  i ve known plenty of men who are violent  get in bar fights with other men over little shit  go nuts on someone for looking at them wrong  they re actually worse of a security threat  but none who i ve seen step in in an actually useful way  like saying  hey  don t punch your girlfriend   i m a bit miffed whenever a man insists male presence is necessary for security  nah  bro  i don t need dead weight   i want to have hope in men  i want to feel all this safety i m supposed to feel around a big  strong guy  i want to feel like men have earned the title of  protector   could y all help me have a little hope    ,-0.09,845

0,what are your best ideas for improving your quality of life  i posted this as a response to a question a few months ago  but i thought it would be worth sharing here as its own post question  i would also like to get more ideas to add to my own below   background  i am a single father  and i recently had to make a lot of drastic changes to my life  one of the things i decided to do was to outsource whatever i could   it has made a wold of difference   these things cost money   i am far from wealthy  but i make enough to make the trade off worth it     at least so far      i hired a   cleaning lady   for once a week to deep clean  it is less expensive than you think  just the basics  i come home on monday after work  and my house smells fresh  toilets clean  sheets changed  kitchen sink shiny  this is a big help     once a month i go to my local mall and   get a massage    the tables are all open and next to each other  so in before  happy ending  comments  you perverts   they know me now  so that makes a big difference     i learned from an ex   how important textiles are    i have zero  actually negative  interior decorating skills  but i can pick up a cheap throw carpet and new pillows for my sofa once a year  now i change them out once a season  makes a huge difference to see things changing once in a while and having new clean things     i keep   a pile of dish towels   on top of my fridge  when one gets old or coffee stained past a certain point  it goes to the garage for the final phase of its life as an oil rag  if i am at a tag sale  i can get a pile for like     they pick up spills  dry hands  wipe tables  pot holders  act as plate drying  rack  next to sink  and they never get nasty because i just keep washing them and swapping them out with a clean one every other day   always good to have these around   cuts down on paper towel use too      i   force myself to socialize    i have lunch or drinks with at least a dozen people a year that i either rarely see  recently met  or need to get to know at work  i have built alliances  created professional relationships  gotten inside scoop and made new friends this way     i pay to have my   laundry washed and folded    this one is expensive  but well worth it  i work for a few hours to pay for an entire month worth of this service  so well worth it   twice a week  i put my laundry on my deck and when i come home it is there folded and clean   huge huge benefit this one     i   order take out   at a few local cheap restaurants   this one is obvious and most people do this once in a while  but one place is very close to me and i can get food there for not too much more than if i cooked it myself  dont ask me how they do it  but it is nice  plus they deliver for free     i   pay a landscaper   to cut the grass once a week  they also weed whack and blow leaves  and other simple cleanup stuff  i have  smallish yards  so this is pretty cheap too   my children and i do all the rest of the chores   dish washing  feeding the pets  taking out trash  cleaning rooms  etc  but it feels easy now  and it has really made a difference for all of us   keep in mind that the cleaning ladies do very minimal work  as do the landscapers  just the basics   otherwise i would not be able to afford it all   and because i have to pay for these things  my lifestyle has become a bit more humble and simple  but my quality of life has shot through the roof  it has also forced me to find cheap or free entertainment   outdoor movies  free events and shows  etc     i hope this list helps  what are your ideas  ,0.9987,701

0,how to deal with a man who you feel plays games here and there  so i was debating with myself today about this subject matter and i wanted to see how men view this from their perspective  there is a man i like and i know he clearly likes me back  i m confident in that fact  however  the problem is  sometimes  i feel like he plays games  not so much in person  but when it comes to texting  it s not bad or anything  we re both mature    year olds but i think he s just  this type of guy   this personality streak quality brings out the desire in me to want to play games with him as well but i resist because i don t think the solution is that  i want to discourage this behavior in him gently  so i was thinking of ways to respond to him when i know he s trying to  act distant  or wants something but is not clearly saying it and so on    let me quickly explain the last situation that brought me to this discussion with myself  we went out for pizza few days ago and i was adamant at of splitting the cost  i put it on my card so he can give me cash because i didn t have cash  well  we had fun and a busy night and both of us forgot   few days later he called me and then texted me that he totally forgot to give me money and would like to pay me back asap via cash app  ok  perfect  he never cash apped me  the next day i made a joke about charging him interest on the money  we laughed about the joke but by the end of the day he still didn t pay me back  well the next day i didn t text him about it  it s the next day after that and still nothing  he s not a dumb guy  i know he didn t forget because he watched my instagram story and there s no way he wouldn t think  oh i forgot to pay her back   part of me feels like he is holding money hostage ina way of  forgetfulness  just wants me to come after him  to get my attention to keep texting him about it  like i said  he s not dumb  i ve known him for many years and he s an extremely detail oriented person  i will not hound him down for the money because i feel like people need to payback and shouldn t constantly be reminded  but when he does pay me back  i know he will  remember   eye roll  eventually    my point is  after this  i want him to know that i m not gonna play dumb  i thought of three ways i could respond to him      act like i am oblivious but play games back  acting like i forgot about the money too   i for sure don t want to do that     just trust in him that hell do it  tell him  when he finally sends it  i trusted that he will do what needs to be done with something like  i didn t forget that you owed me that money   but i trusted you ll get around to it when you had a minute       call him out on how long it took  i didn t forget about the money  but i was curious how long it would take for you to give it back so i can give you a personal credit worthiness rating   or something along those lines that says  i remember and am making mental notes of your actions       remind him about the money yet again  i don t want to do this either  i know he s not a dumbass and is not that  forgetful   i feel like this is exactly what he wants me to do   if you re a man  which scenario sends a more clear message to you so i can achieve what i want to hear which is discourage confusing communication and actions  ,0.9983,682

0,what should i    m  do about my girlfriends    f  guy friend whos in love with her and kinda obsessed   theres that my girlfriends guyfriend whos in love with her  i never really bothered about that  i always trusted my girlfriend and her love for me and that she picked me even when she knew his love  and she never really had feelings for him and never saw him as more than a friend  till that day when she told me about the time they sexted  she told me when she was dissociated and talking some random shit  i was angry about that but i let it go as it happened   or   years ago and even then she didnt have feelings for him and nothing happened in real life like they never kissed or even hold hands  and i didnt really wanna be possessive and controlling as im not that kind of guy  i forgot about that  they didnt talk that much  they barely met  away from our relationship  he used to stress her by stalking her and forcing conversations even when she blocked him he tried to talk on another application or another way even emailed her  she didnt wanna end their  friendship  as she didnt wanna lose him and hes been around for a while and he didnt have a lot of friends and that hes depressed and shit  i didnt really bother all of that as shes an adult and mature enough to make her own decisions and i shouldnt tell her what to do and what not to do  all i did was advise her and give my opinion when she asked for it and it was that she should end this friendship with closure as i didnt like him putting pressure on her and for the sake of everyone as he is hurting too waiting for her love and care so its not healthy anymore and shes not just a friend for him even when he says that hes not waiting for anything but we all knew that hes waiting for her  it was just my advice not really more and not an order  up until the day she met him without telling me  not only that but she also lied to me about it and also sent a picture of her meal showing that shes alone but she wasnt  i knew she was lying  i got my hands on some proof  when i asked her more than once at different times whether she heard anything from him this christmas she denied anything but she didnt know that i already knew  when i confronted her that i know they met with the proof she couldnt deny it  i got so angry we almost broke up and i already made the decision  she kept crying and asking me not to leave her and that she was afraid and kept swearing that she was going to tell me  i was hurt  but i forgave her because i love her and i know she loves me but she made a mistake and i wont lose much by giving her another chance with making it clear its gonna be her last chance and it cant happen again  i wont let it  when i asked her why she was afraid of telling me and if she didnt feel safe around me and if she thought i was judgmental  she said no  she feels safe and thinks that im not judgmental but she just needed some time  now a problem happened because of him and we almost broke up  i know shes the one who lied to me but because she was afraid to tell me about meeting him  he asked to see her  and she didnt wanna let him down at the entrance of the new year  plus she tried to commit suicide a while ago and thats a reason she met him she said and kind of goodbye in case she tries to do that again  but i cant really stand him anymore  maybe we can make sure that this wont happen again by ending this friendship  i think i can ask her to do that now and she will do it  but should i do it  or should i let her take the decision herself  knowing that if i leave it to her  she wont be able to do that   or should i let the time fix it   ,-0.4226,739

1,honest opinion on my first love story i just want peoples honest reaction and opinions because this has been such an epically fucked up story     amp  x   b   so this all started when i was    years old  i met this boy with lanky  tan skinned  curly blonde hair  and the bluest eyes  he had very boyish features and i remember his hair made me liken him to a baby duck   he was   years older than me just finishing up his freshmen year of high school and i was at the end of  th grade  young i know  we met through a sports team that wasnt associated with any school and he had played the sport for highschool and wanted to continue his skills and not lose stamina on the off season  i happened to be quite good despite being   years younger so we often trained together  my initial reaction to him was that i developed a teensy little crush because i thought he was cute  and i harbored this crush on him while i began to get know him a little bit more and he turned out to be quite the attention whore  he was a total people pleaser and wanted people to like him  which in all honesty who doesnt  however  it was very apparent with him that he wanted everyone to like him which honestly annoyed the crap out me  and egged on by my best friend at the time who absolutely hated him helped convince me to dislike him despite still harboring a crush on him   i leave shortly there after meeting him since i always spent the summers at my grandparents house and didnt see him for a couple months  i didnt think much of him at the time and when i came back i was indifferent to seeing him again  i was starting  th grade at this point in my young life and was at the starting point of my trail down an eating disorder  my grandmother often criticized that i was built like a tank and would tell me that i would be prettier if i was thinner  i was    and     lb i wasnt exactly  built like a tank  being a highly active kid that had sports practice for   hours everyday for   days a week plus school meant that it didnt take long for my eating disorder to become fully fledged  now this guys role in all of this was that he was the first person to take me aside and full on ask me if i was ok   we were talking before our practice started and we had the old team pictures out and he commented that he couldnt find me in any of them  i pointed myself out to him and he couldnt really believe that that was me  i remember him telling me that hey i noticed youve lost a lot of weight in a short amount time  are you actually doing ok  you really shouldnt get any thinner  at this point i was halfway through  th grade    and about    lb  i was deciding which high school i wanted to go to and he was in his sophmore year  i remember after that he would do small things for me like grab my water bottle if i forgot it after practice and grab equipment for me if i needed it  at this point i was never really happy when i was at practice due to never eating enough and i had moved up in the team to the highest group we had so the kids i practiced with were all in high school and my teammates always joked that i hated everyone and had a hitlist of people i got annoyed at because here was this little    year old girl getting snappy at the upper classmen when they messed up the set we were doing   im going to call the guy i liked w from now just to make it a little more understandable  however  w would always go along with these jokes and when he would do those little things for me he would poke fun at me and ask if he went any higher or lower on my hitlist  then it was the second semester of the school year after practice and it was dark and my mom was late to pick me up and he was waiting with me until she got there because it was dark and he was asking me what high school i decided to go to  and he was trying to convince me to go to the same was one as him because they needed more good people for the sports team but i of course was going to a different high school and he was not there for it  but life went on and he still jabbed at me to go to the same high school as him but i never did  its the summer at this point and were doing a lot of outside practice activities with each other as a team  and one of them is going to watch fireworks and its just us as the older group of the team all pilled into the back of one of the seniors trucks and were all snuggled under blankets and of course i spend the entire nigh talking to him and joking around as were sitting right next to each other cuddled up under the blankets  life continues im still not the biggest fan of his attention seeking behavior and hes started to develop a crush on one the older girls on our team  which i didnt care about at the time because i had a crush on him  but like it wasnt big enough that i cared if he liked other girls  but he liked her and it was blatantly obvious and everyone teased him for it  anyway continuing on through that summer i was beginning to gain a little weight back and was no where restored but i was getting better  my freshmen year of high school started and that was a major adjustment for me  my next distinct memory of w was when he went to the corn maze as a team  and we got lost for a solid     hours because he was leading us through the maze  but his crush on this girl on our team was absolutely and blatantly running circles around him and i didnt really talk to him much anymore  then that girl got a boyfriend that he didnt find out about for a while so he kinda cooled down a little bit and wasnt spending every minute of practice with her  and it was kinda normal again we joked at practice and during sets our coach would play music and we would argue about which era it was from and he would act as my overprotective big brother when another team came to practice with us and i had gotten stuck with the guys  now at this point i am a freshmen in high school and w is a junior high school and hes started to look less like a baby duck  hes letting his hair grow out so its longer and has that blonde curly california surfer boy look  hes gotten taller  and hes started to fill out more and his jawline has definitely gotten sharper and his baby face is very much less noticeable  but hes still that fucking annoying little    year old boy who would correct my grammar in the group chats so  however  unfortunately at this point girls are starting to notice that hes actually turned out quite hot and no longer looks like a baby duck faced nerd  im not exactly happy but im still meh on him besides thinking wow he got hotter  we get closer the second semester of school and we joke around more and i see him after his highschool practices because theyre in the same place our regular practice are at  now my folks  this is where shit hits the fucking fan  summer  starts  im talking to him all the time we spend all of practice together goofing off and messing with each other  i fall hard  i fall fast  and im completely in love with that duck faced boy who has now turned into this very hot  tall  blonde haired  blue eyed  surfer boy and everyone fucking knows it  i make him watch dumb chick flicks with me and were talking till   am  were at meets and im sitting on his lap and stealing his sweatshirts  hes randomly back hugging me and picking me up  in between events im sitting in his lap trying to braid his hair  during our bigger meets where we have trials in the morning finals in the afternoon and we go to someones house to chill out for a few hours were napping together on the couch very much tangled up together  now enter the girl on the team whose not the girl he had a crush on but the first girl on the team who befriended him who now hates me with every fiber of her being  shes does everything to get between us  and god does it piss me off  we work around it and its fine  and then enter problem     a guy ive been friends with since i was    but havent seen for a year or two because hes been in a foreign country comes back to our team for a bit  w gives me several warnings about the guy and how he isnt quite the same and hes heavily into drugs and alcohol now  which of course hes right about   i would also like to note this guy w was my first guy girl thing i had to deal with because i didnt care enough in middle school to bother so i dont know the fuck im doing at this point the summer is winding down  w is going to start his senior year soon and im going to be a sophomore  and im wanting w to ask me out finally  so i decide to flirt with my guy friend a little bit to make w jealous and move that process a long  majorly backfires  my guy friend thinks its fucking great and that i want to date him and w is no longer talking to me  he cold shoulders me and hardly speaks to me anymore  he comes to practice less and less to the point where he stop and so does my guy friend and that girl w was friends with hates me even more  so here i am absolutely fucking crushed because the guy that has been the first guy for me to ever fall completely head over heels for has cold shoulder me and wont talk to me  i dont see him for   months and he wont respond to my texts anymore  i see him again and hes pissed  he wont talk to me at all now  a months passes  my weight drops again  i barely weigh   lb  high school season for our sport starts so hes no longer doing our club one and hes doing only highschool so i see him but barely  hes trying to get me to talk to him now  hes interacting with me whenever i see him  hes trying to get me to talk to him  i refuse  im tired  i tried to get him to talk to me before  i tried to text him  i tried to ask him if he was doing ok  so im done  i do what he did to me  the next thing i know is one of the girls on our team who was my first friend there starts talking about her boyfriend and how shes going to prom with him and she has to pick out her prom things  and im like cool ill help  i like to pick out fancy dresses  but then i ask who the prom date is  its fucking w  and i hear this and my heart feels like its burning out of my chest  i cant focus for a solid minute  i want to cry and i want to scream but i cant even form words because my throat feels so constricted and my heart is dropping and its dropping fast  and to this day i never felt as much as i did when that girl told me she was going out with w than i did then  i leave practice early  i cant fucking function  i want to cry but i cant because i know theres no reasoning behind it  we never dated  he wasnt mine  he never was  so i console myself i tell myself hes happy and that i should be happy for him so i help her pick out her prom things  i have to listen to her gush about him and i nod my head because i know exactly what shes talking about  i know how sweet and caring and dorky he his  i know exactly what shes experiencing for the first time  of course i hear about prom  and of course he wins prom king because hes without a shadow of doubt everyones favorite and everyones darling  she sends me the prom photos and i want to die but i tell her how gorgeous she looks and completely ignore his presence in the photos  i have to listen to how she slept with him on prom night and my ears are on fire  i dont want to hear this  i dont want to listen to this  i want out and i want away  he breaks up with her a week later  they barely dated for a month  hes graduating now and i send him a happy graduation message and wish him luck at college  we end up conversing that entire summer  however  i never see him as hes quit the team and hes working  and when i ask him why he tells me that he new it would have worked out the summer before but now that hes leaving for college soon he doesnt want to emotionally fuck me up  i say ok  the summer drags on i get more and more annoyed with him  hes changed a lot  hes not nearly as sweet and caring  he smokes a lot  drinks a lot  is defintley a class a fuckboy  i dont mention any of these thoughts to him  instead  im the emotional girlfriend for him  he tell me everything and i act as his emotional crutch of who he calls at   am drunk to say i love yous  im working that summer with some guys he knows from school who i mention to him and afterwards this guy wont step foot in a   foot radius from me  and im just like really  youre going to make it so other guys wont even talk to me  are you fucking kidding me  the summer continues on  i never see him but i talk to him up until the time he has to move into college  at this point im fried  i just wanted to see him before he left but i want to leave it on a good note so i wish him luck at college and cease talking to him  a few months go by and i talk to him over thanksgiving break  we talk for the first time about what happened that summer that i fell in love with him  its fun and sweet and for the first time in a long time hes the guy i fell in love with  theres no pretense of the fuckboy and ass he turned into  its who he actually is as a person  we admit that we both liked each other at the same time and we express our regret of fucking things up  he tells me no matter i will always love you and i will never stop even when we drift apart  because as it turned out i was his first love as much as he was mine  we talk and i tell him my parents want me to visit the college hes going to and he told me that i should just drop by and hell take me around for the day and that we can just hang out  i talk to him about what i want to study and the trajectory i want to go on which coincidentally is the same one he wants to do to  we both want to become medical research doctors  we agree to meet up over winter break  i also found out the entire time i was talking to him over the summer and he was drunk texting me at   am telling me he loved me he was hooking up with girls left and right  it hurt  he was never mine  but for all the things he told me to learn that hurt  the break comes quickly we arrange plans but theres a caveat  he wants to include a guy we both know who hes really good friends  im fine with this  im buddies with this guy its cool  then he wants to include the girl he was friends with who hated me and still does because she liked him  im unhappy about this  i stretch my schedule and tell him i might be busy and it will be difficult for me to see him  i dont want to be around this girl with him there  he tells me that the whole point of this was to see me  i call bullshit  the day comes our mutual buddy is driving all of us  theyre in the front seat me and the girl are in the back  hes feeding the girl cookies from the front see and pretty much flirting with her  and he cant even fucking make eye contact with me much less say shit  we go to the beach  the tide is high so theres no beach  the girls older brother lives close by so we go and crash at his house while hes at work  w and the girl get high together  im chilling with our mutual buddy because neither of us smoke and much less have any intention of doing so  still w hasnt said anything to me  we go to get food  nothing  i want to go home so fucking badly at this point  its finally time to go and i give the girl a hug and our mutual buddy and ws fucking stone cold  i give him one anyway  im home and i cry for a solid hour  i dye my hair blue with box dye  i get two more ear piercings  i say fuck him and go and date my guy friend that he warned me about  i date   different guys in the span of the   weeks since i see him over winter break  i kiss   guys in the span of a night because i dont care anymore  im so tired of harboring feelings for him and for him to not even look me in the eye and then treat me like i dont even exist when i see him  i dont text him again  i start talking to this guy whose a senior at ws old high school whose best friends with the guy who i worked with over the summer who avoided me after i talked to w  this guy im talking becomes super pushy with me  red flags spring up  i message some old friends of mine that go to that high school they tell me he was physically abusive to his past girlfriends and so was his best friend  the guy i worked with  i learn that the guy who avoided me at work all summer did so because w had a talk with him and made it out that we were dating so that he wouldnt bother me  ,0.9984,3308

1,i guess this is the best place to post this  would really appreciate some advice  i m    really want to be friends with her f    but not sure it s gonna happen    not really sure how to write this but i ll try my best  so basically  my whole life i ve never had a female friend that i can just text and we can hang out  i ve had distant female friends but never a close one  up until recently  i got really close with a friend who was a classmate and we ended up hanging out so much that i got a crush on her and we went out for a short stint before that went to shit  i was so depressed at the end of it  i didn t care about losing a girlfriend  i cared about losing that female friend i once had    which brings me to the reason for my post  and some of you might roll your eyes at what i m about to say but i m going to say it anyway  so  this past saturday  i went to a strip club with some friends  when we go to a specific strip club  i only get dances from   girl  my reason being is that she s the only one that peaks my interest because she s incredibly sexy and we always have great conversation  of course  if she wanted to hook up or be in a relationship  i m all for it  however  i realized that i really want to see if she would want some sort of friendship  i ve followed her on instagram for a while and over time have noticed how she s just a cool girl  family oriented and just a sweetheart  we always talk about our lives  education  travel plans  etc during the private dances  i m sure it means nothing and strippers do it a lot but she gave me her number way back from one of the first dances i got from her  i m not saying she was interested in me because she gave it to me but i m at least hoping it was a sign of trust at the time and there s still trust there  this past saturday  she even revealed that she s a victim of domestic abuse and i thought it was cool how she confided in me with that information  then again  i m not sure if i m the only guy she s told that to at the strip club    my only dilemma is that is it even possible to express to a stripper you want to be friends with her without her thinking you re full of shit and just have an ulterior motive to eventually sleep with her  i ve posted this question in other threads and somebody mentioned that i should just ask her to go out for some coffee since that s an innocent public scene that friends do but i still feel like if i was to ask that  it s hinting that i want a date with her  i don t know  i guess it s just not common for me to see people asking others on a friend date so i feel like it wouldn t work  i know i m ranting and the only way i can get a friendship with her is if i eventually ask her but i was just hoping for some advice  thanks for the read  ,0.9955,580

1,women that actively decided not to have children  how did you come to that decision  i want to first explain that i am very aware that there are hundreds of thousands of women that maybe would have chosen to become pregnant and give birth and have children  and couldnt due to various reasons out of their control   in this post  im specifically curious to hear from women that  as far as they knew know  had or have the opportunity to have children  and have made the decision not to do so  please share anything relevant that comes to mind about your experience  that you might wish to share with someone that is also considering not trying for children   the reason that i am asking is not at all from a place of judgement   its actually the opposite  im in my mid late twenties  and am not sure whether i want to have kids  some days i happily imagine having   kids  some days i happily imagine having no kids  some days the sacrifices and challenges seem worth it  some days the sacrifices and challenges dont seem worth it  so  im basically just wanting to talk to women who have experienced both so i can better understand my own feelings about it  ill probably make another post asking the same of women that actively decided to try for children   thanks in advance for any sharing  ,0.9855,233

1,frustrated w gf  want her to be happy tldr  how do i make my girlfriend feel less stressed about partaking in a hobby that brings me a lot of happiness   first some background  we met by happenstance  we are very similar and even enjoy playing video games a lot  i used to work a lot when i first moved to this town  like    hour weeks for the first year or so  hit    hrs one week  go overtime pay   met her  decided i want to take this a little more seriously with her and not let other things become a priority over her    naturally we really took to playing games together  asked her if shed like a really fancy gaming chair like mine and a bigger desk to share with me and all  so ive spent a lot of money getting this setup for us    as the weeks have gone on  she hasnt sat down to game with me very often despite many numerous requests for her to join me and my friends online    after many attempts to ask her to play with me i start asking why she is so hesitant  turns out she thinks im a little too serious and aggressive online  shes afraid she will make a wrong move and be judged  she says she needs to play these games on her own so she doesnt have the fear of making a wrong move and being judged  but shes mostly afraid of how ill act if shes messes up  shes heard me get frustrated with my friends when they do something in a  serious  game and doesnt want to risk having that happen to her  the thing is i dont see myself the way she does  i dont slam my fists  i dont yell or if i do its not very often and not due to anger  though there was one instance where a griefer random teammate was killing our team and i got pissed at the guy  but most of the time my friends and i just play the game and have fun  if we are screwing up too much and getting rocked we switch to a less stressful game and mellow out  she equated the stress she felt when playing with me to handling deadly poisonous snakes for the first time  she used to do that irl    because i used to work so much  i didnt have time to go out during the week or on the weekends  i stayed home  did laundry and cooked and dishes all while chatting with long time friends who  like me  moved all over the us  its the only way we stay in touch besides the occasional text  i play video games with my friends because i miss my friends  without video games  i sadly dont have very many friends in this new town  i always have had a small circle  so the   or   friends in this town i do have are all i feel i need  but i also dont want to cut video games out because that means detaching myself from people ive grown up with and known my whole life  and somehow they make it work with their spouses and such  granted non play with them that ive seen  we go out pretty often and play pool or hang out with friends  went to the aquarium last weekend  so its not like this is the only thing i want to do    but this is something that i really enjoy doing and it keeps me close to old friends  i want to make her apart of something that makes me happy  because she makes me happy and i want her to be happy too  and get to know my friends  i just dont know what to do  i dont want to stress her out  she has plenty of that with her job  her boss is a total dick  and a sexist asshole  and i want her to look forward to coming home and playing a couple hours of games with people who look forward to seeing you online  ,0.9974,680

1,opportunity or oppression   ive lived alone as a nomad my entire life  traveling and essentially putting my head down wherever i find myself     think of it kind of like being a traveling journalist adventurer and youll have the basic idea of it   maybe its true that  the grass is always greener   but lately ive been considering that it might be nice to have some kind of creature comfort  maybe something like an actual  home   where there is food  a warm bed  that kind of thing  that i could go to sometimes    and im starting to think about how that could be done   its a challenge because ive literally never lived in a  home   so i dont know the first thing about it  and i also dont have time to do the things that i want  i just want the benefit of them   so i want meals being made  dusting     basic housewife kind of things  like being married in the     s     except i am not the least bit interested in romance or being  married   thats simply not something i want   i dont even know how to describe the  relationship   since you could think of it as being married except without being married  or an employer employee kind of  live in housekeeper  or  long term caregiver  or whatever  or even think of it almost like being family  except that i am particular and like things the way that i like them  so i would be the head of it   so my question  is this the kind of thing that a woman  it could be a man too  i suppose  but for some reason i imagine it as being a woman   would consider an opportunity    or is that kind of thing just so outside the norm now that it is only seen as a kind of oppression    really what would have been perfect would have been a boarding house where someone cooks and cleans and that kind of thing  but those places dont exist anymore in the united states  ,0.9949,336

1,visited my best friend  left depressed advice hey there  ladies     i could really use some girl advice right now     i made a friend in a writing community over a year ago and we became super close  talked every day  facetimed a bunch  and she became my best friend  we both had vacation days to use and we decided to finally meet up and have a fun vacation together     the first few red flags was when it didn t seem like she was as excited for me to go as i was  i asked a bunch on numerous occasions if she still felt comfortable with me flying to spend time with her  and didn t put any pressure on her if she didn t   i just wanted to make other plans since i bought plane tickets if not  she insisted she did     then comes the big day  we are excited to finally meet but the first time we do  i didn t feel any of the excitement from her side  i brushed it off as being tired from traveling and a bit too sensitive     then the days kept rolling on  we hardly talked  and i kept feeling like a burden and not wanted there  we would go to places together and she wouldn t even stick around  would venture off without me  i kept feeling horrible but tried to brush it off  i m just being sensitive  that s all     dinner one night  we got to a place she loves and whilst talking  she makes the joke that i should leave  after feeling so horrible  naturally the joke doesn t land  i try to keep it off my face but i ended up crying in her car soon after  we were on our way to a show and i asked if we could still go because i didn t want to ruin the night  but when e stood in line  it was clear she was overwhelmed and extremely anxious  i dragged her out of line and i found a bench for us to talk about  she cried that how silent i was being after i cried made her feel insecure and that i wasn t going to be friends with her  i reassured her and we went back to the show     but nothing changed  the next day came and we spent an entire day in her home not talking  it was like i wasn t even there  i was so emotionally drained i went to where i was sleeping and cried  i guess she heard me and i told her i wanted to talk  i told her how i was feeling and she reassured me that she did want me there  but i couldn t shake how i was feeling  she also kept calling me a  writing partner  instead of a friend  and when i confronted her  she said that we were close friends  when i consider her a best friend   it just rubbed in the wound and i eventually asked after awhile if i could get some sleep  i decided my expectations were wrong and would readjust them for the remainder of the trip     the night before my last day  there was no mention of me leaving  no sadness  no  i m going to miss you   or dreading i m leaving  nothing  it was very strange  then the morning of  there was nothing either  but when we got to the airport  she finally showed emotion and cried as she said goodbye  it s been a few days that i ve been back and there s still been no mention of me being gone  no missing me or anything    which feels odd given how close we have been     i don t know how to feel  was i correct that i was being too sensitive and had too high of expectations for the trip  or do you think if in my situation you may have felt the same  has anyone been in a situation like this before  ,-0.9025,665

1,how to get over my  break up  with my high school best friend  from the ages of    to    i had this friend  we ll call her anna  who was my best friend  we were attached at the hip practically  i went over to her house all the time  stayed for dinner most weekends  always together  she was my soul sister    a year or so after we met  in  th grade  i kind of just knew anna was gay  and in the back of my mind i was excited for her to come out and be comfortable with who she was  but i  of course  never brought it up  our sophomore year of high school  after exam day  we were napping in her room when anna planted one on me  i now know i m bisexual but i didn t then  but anyway i was excited by the kiss but also it scared me because i had a boyfriend at the time and i panicked  afterwards  i said i wanted to talk about it and she said  what  it was bound to happen anyway   we never talked about it after that and carried on as usual    towards the end of sophomore year  i could sense our friendship deteriorating  we would talk for hours after school every day to her dodging my calls or saying she was busy  she started hanging out with this other group of girls in my grade  catholic all girls school  graduating class of      and wasn t really available anymore and when i asked if something was wrong she d say no  one day  i don t know why i did this and i know it was wrong  but i tried to anonymously ask her a question through her tumblr page that basically would get her to admit that she was gay  and forgetting she was kind of a techie  i didn t think she d be able to know it was me  but she did  and i remember her response post on her page saying  it s come to my attention that someone tried using my inbox to get me to admit personal information about myself  i feel extremely violated   etc  it carried on  i felt really bad after that  i didn t realize at the time that it wasn t my right or my place to try and pry that out of her because even if she was my best friend  i wasn t entitled to know everything  i cringe thinking about it now    i never got to apologize before summer break and when we came back she had cut her hair really short and changed her style and stayed with that other group of friends  what ensued was her and this other girl bullying me relentless for a two years to the point where i almost dropped out of high school  they spread rumors about me  saying that i was a slut and that i had slept with this senior girl s boyfriend  i definitely had not  i was pretty geeky and awkward in high school and didn t even know a boy tbh   it got around to the teachers and nobody would look at me  i spent lunches eating in empty classrooms or taking walks outside to get away from everyone  anna and the other girls were from the wealthiest families at our school and thus their financial leverage made them untouchable   sadly at most private schools it s only how much money you have that gets you noticed     anna would later go on to tell our principle that i told her to commit suicide  i did not   anna was my best friend at one point  i loved her still    i tried confronting her one day and she just pushed past me    it s been   years since we were friends  the worst part for me is that to this day  i have very vivid dreams of her  it s always me telling her how much i miss her and how i miss being her friend  in every dream we re always friends again  i dream about her     times a month  it bothers me so much because i feel like i can t escape the memory  it sounds crazy i know    i recently found her on linkedin  she blocked me in high school on everything so this was the only way  and messaged her  i kept it short and sweet and simply said that i regretted how things went down and that i was sorry for hurting her  i told her i hoped she was well and still keeping up with her dream of writing a novel    i never heard back  we seem like extremely different people now and like we wouldn t be friends now  but idk  i strangely still inexplicably miss her despite how horribly she and that other girl bullied me  to the point where i was cutting my arms out of depression and grief   i m an extremely emotional person and when i experience loss really heavily    how can i get over this when i won t receive closure  i just want to move on  ,0.9499,854

1,women of reddit what did i do wrong that i was not enough to be loved in return the way i showed her love  this was my first long term relationship and i dont understand why they did this to me  hi  all i am    f lesbian and i was in an age gap relationship with a woman in her   s who was never married  we met each other online on a dating website and we would talk but i then turned her down and suggested we just be friends  however  she continued to contact me and would check up on me  asking me how my day was  making herself available  help me in any way she could  and would try to cheer me up  because of this i then gave them a chance and she asked if we could talk on the phone  which i agreed to  because of this i then changed my mind and we went out on dates  the relationship was great we were always spending time together  i always made sure i showed her how much i cared for her  she would make me breakfast  and comfort me and i would comfort her  i was the only person she ever dated and spoke to about her severe epilepsy and having a hole in her head  i opened up to her about my depression and suicidal tendencies and she opened up to me about herself wanting to commit suicide at an early age because of her epilepsy  i then started falling in love with her  she was everything to me and she meant the world to me  around     months everything changed out of nowhere  i did not see her for a whole month and she told me it was because of work  i have anxiety so i started to worry if it was because of another reason  i have abandonment issues because of an abusive father so i started worrying something was wrong or i did something wrong  i then asked if we could meet up because i was afraid i was losing her and unsure of what was happening  i brought her flowers and i gave her a card that stated how much she meant to me  she then mumbled   i would never do this for someone   and i asked her to repeat that and asked her why she said this and she said she was just joking  note i did not realize this was a red flag at the time   from there onward i did see her but it would be at most once a week to   times a week  as we developed a closer bond seeing one another for such a little amount of time made me become anxious  i would become insecure in the relationship  however  i continued to respect her boundaries  she had a controlling mother who lived   blocks away from her and my ex was co dependent on her mother but also her mother would constantly harass her daughter to be available when she needed her  she would also tell my ex to die alone  i was always comforting my ex that nothing of what her mother says is in any way a reflection of her but how her mother perceives the world around her and that her being gay is not a burden  and i would remind her she is perfect the way she was  i would drop off pastries for her  buy her cute cards  comfort her  i would do just about anything for her because i loved her  she seemed to never have anyone consistent in her life so i made sure to show her she could confide in me and that i would give her the love she never got   i told her that i loved her   months into the relationship  she told me she was not sure if she could love me back  yet continued to date me and acted as she loved me  she would wear my clothes  like always being close to me  we would constantly talk for hours when we would spend time together  however  any time i told her i loved her she would freak out  when we were apart she also was very detached when we were not in the same place together  similar to avoidant attachment she would say to me that she likes being independent  she does not like to think about love and all the goodies it has to offer  nothing ever bothers me  i am not going to change for anyone  etc   there was one time we were in bed and she said something oddly peculiar which was that she wanted to  rape and kill me  she said both  in bed on different occasions only once while being on top of me  note we were never into anything kinky   anyway long story short   months into the relationship she sends me a card to my apartment and never mentions it  the day before returning to my apartment i dropped off a cake for her  when i arrived at my apartment which i was selling i read the letter  she was breaking up with me saying how i treated her better than anyone ever has in her entire life  what she loved about me  and how sad she felt that she deceived me  and said what is the point of trying again when it will fail  she said other things and used this quote      the sad part is  that i will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than i loved you when i knew you      but the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them      later on  i agreed to be her friend to compensate for her issues hoping if i help her in some way we could be together again  when we were friends she would touch me constantly  pay for meals  and take me out to fun events  but it did put me into a deep depression and i would cry every day because i could not spend the time i wish i could with her as a gf since we no longer were not in a relationship   long story short i told her i cannot do it anymore i cannot handle not seeing her i loved her and my heart couldnt handle it  i would constantly go back and forth on keeping her in my life due to my love for her  and she would also say how shed miss me so i would retract saying i would not allow her to be in my life  anyway  i told her i was not sure if she was using me because it got confusing but i need to end our relationship  she then said that i am confusing her saying one minute i do not want her in my life the next being ok with friendship  she then said to me that i should see a therapist because i have an issue with handling relationships  this hurt me deeply and we have not talked since but recently we did  ,0.997,1206

1,what does a beautiful young woman lack in her life  i found myself recently imagining what would it be like to be a pretty girl woman and i cant think of a single serious struggle she would have  like sex and dating is taken care of  she gets swamped with guys on a daily basis all she has to do is pick  ive never even seen a pretty girl be single for more then a month or two  money is also never a problem  she gets free stuff all the time  men take care of her and cushion her every step  and an attractive girl can make  a lot of  money in ridiculously easy ways such as modeling or simply playing some games on twitch  security  not being secure as a woman is a thing of the past  women in modern times get away with behavior that would get them raped and killed in   seconds just     years ago  youd have to be really dumb to get into a dangerous situation as a woman  and you can always carry some pepper spray or a tazer  generally girls look good on average and even if not they have a lot of options to improve their looks  so what i said applies to a lot of female population actually  so what is it  what do you lack in your life as an attractive girl  ,0.9479,231

1,hello ladies  im a male  looking for female perspective on something that happened at work  where women were given special treatment i used to work in retail for a very well known company  the brand is recognized in america  uk  and some parts of europe  but this branch operates in dubai  one of the richest states in the world      to continue this  i want to make sure everyone reading this knows what a shop inventory is  its when a shop has to manually scan every single item it has for sale  using handheld barcode scanners   this is done to make sure that the items shown to be available in the shop system  are actually there  and not stolen or broken  or lost in transportation and such  this is done     times yearly  some shops close for the day and do this  my shop had everyone work full shift  close  and then start scanning into the early hours  because closing for the day would ensure a loss between       k in revenue   this was standard practice not just for my shop  anyway  the legality of this is not what is important in this question       now on to why i am seeking your opinions       we had one such inventory  our store manager was known for treating females very well  that ranged from sending them home when sick  to actively pushing them for promotions  so   am  we are approaching the     point of scanning  this is when the people who have morning shift that day would go home and report in at      am  leaving the rest to continue  our manager  for the first time during such an inventory  decided to allow all the female workers to go home at   as well  saying that they are the weaker sex and these conditions are hard on them  all the females were elated  feeling appreciated and smiling  and all  except for one  left      that meant that the number of people left for scanning was halved  and the time that was needed to finish prolonged  the guy who was responsible for the stockroom could not go home earlier  because some stocks were in the stockroom and only he knew where    department managers relied on him being there  we finished around   am  and the stockroom guy  who worked    hours by then  had a new shift start in   hours  there was no point in going home      our shop doesnt pay overtime  so the payment for the inventory is fixed  and all the females who went home at    would get the same pay as we who stayed behind       my question is  as a female  how do you feel about this  ,0.9891,437

1,in need of womens advice on how to proceed with a female friend of mine after being rejected hello women of reddit  new redditor here in great need of advice  i   m need some help navigating my relationship with a female friend following being rejected  this might get a bit lengthy so buckle up    heres the deal  i met this cool girl a couple months ago through mutual involvement in certain groups at university and we got to be pretty good friends over the course of a couple months  both of us opened up to one another more than i think either of us are accustomed to doing and things were super duper  lots of exciting conversation   anyhow  i started seeing signs of what i interpreted to be flirty behavior on her end  normally i wouldnt trust my own judgement on this sort of thing  but no less than three mutual friends approached me and told me  unsolicited  that i was being dense and needed to ask her out  all the classic signs  she would laugh at my jokes and touch my shoulder when doing so  would intentionally leave group meetings at the same time as me and then invite me to sit and talk with her afterwards  invited me to her small birthday party  called  me over a break unbidden and talked until  am about how she was lonely  and even requested a hug from me at one point despite generally not being a very touchy person  we have a lot of inside jokes   anyhow  once i had this pointed out to me i started to wonder how i could have been so oblivious to miss all these messages  so i finally worked up the guts to ask her on a date annnndddd she said no  said that she was too busy and wasnt the dating type of person  after three weeks of no contact    so im confused  im not heartbroken or anything  ive been happily single by my own choice for quite a while now but figured id give this a go since we got along so well  so im     indifferent to her rejecting me  its her prerogative after all  but i really really dont want to lose such a good  exciting friendship   despite her assurances that everything is cool and that there are no hard feelings between us  even apologizing for sending confusing signals  our friendship lacks the same ease  vigor  and humor that it once had  things just feel stressed and awkward  and she barely ever initiates conversation or seems eager to continue them like she used to   what can i do to get back to the way things were  is this even possible  ive been careful not to be pushy or overbearing  i text her maybe once a week just to talk about general life things and see her every week at group meetings    im not a very flirty person  and now im wondering if the whole reason she was ever interested in being my friend was because i was one of the few guys not trying to impress her all the time  shes very attractive and social gets a lot of male attention     so what do i do  do i just have to watch this fade unless she changes her mind  she had become one of my best friends and it pains me to watch this happen    many thanks to all who labored through this whole mess  and thanks in advance to all who respond  ,0.9972,581

1,is this girl interested and should i do anything  i met this girl in a school related group around the middle of last year  i went back a couple of times mostly for a chance to get to talk to her one on one  it never really happened  weve had very slight interactions  and it seems like shell always make some very short comment to me if nothing else  i stopped going to the group because a certain person there made me uncomfortable  and i dont want to go back because of them   i know where this girl works  and im thinking about going in there one day to talk to her and to see where it goes  but i question if thats the right decision    were both in our   s  and are in seemingly similar places of being kind of alone and unsure of if itll ever change  she tries to act like shes having fun  but she seems lonely deep down  and i am too  the way we carry ourselves is similar  of being the type who is more quiet and reserved  who acts like weve got it together  and takes awhile to open up to someone    i didnt feel an immediate spark when i first met her  although i did feel an attraction  i dont know if this yearning for her that ive been feeling is actually feelings for her  of its just me being scared of being alone  i am the type to take awhile before accepting that i like someone   the last time we spoke there was mention of a new years party  and i expressed my interest in going  i went because i thought she was going to be there  and she wasnt  she knew i was going to be going  and if she were interested in getting to know me  she should have been there  she also looked right through me when holding a door open once  so i dont know if she likes me at all    she has a tattoo in the same place that my ex does  this worries me because it took me awhile to accept liking her as well  and she turned out to be a very cold  deceptive individual   i also built my ex up to be this deep sensitive girl that she wasnt  i dont know if im doing the same here    i really dont know if shes guarded like i am and likes me  or if its all in my head  i dont know if this girl was just being friendly to me of if she thought i was cute  what should i do  ,0.9939,438

1,good looking men with markedly less attractive female partners im curious to find out what goes through your mind when you encounter a man who is  to all appearances  a good looking or otherwise attractive guy  romantically partnered with a woman whom you regard as unattractive   she may not even be physically unattractive  generally speaking  but when her looks are contrasted with the mans  you cant help but notice a discrepancy   to be clear  im not implying that there should be a match or a close gap between one partners physical beauty and the others  i should also note that to explore this idea it would be best to imagine that the  discrepancy  is significant  i e  a guy you think is  hot  with a gal you think is physically unattractive   were all familiar with the usual explanations and judgements people give when the situation is flipped  hot gal with physically unattractive guy   but id like to see what you have to say should you come across a couple in the opposite  presumably less common scenario  draw upon actual experience or just imagine what you might think   im wondering about things like your knee jerk reaction and what you might speculate about the nature of the guys interest in his partner  i think its fair to state that men disproportionately favour youth and beauty compared to other qualities  so i have to imagine that when a woman sees a man apparently holding other qualities in higher regard  that it must stand out  it must make you think   i also wonder what you might think in this situation should you happen to feel strong sexual attraction towards the guy  or should you have a genuine desire to date or become an intimate with him    and  you regard yourself as better looking than his current partner  alternatively  what if his partner were about as equally attractive as you  what if she was more attractive  i would imagine that you would experience different thoughts and feelings in each scenario   theres more detail that i could add to my hypothetical scenarios  but ill leave it at that  id be interested to see what anyone has to say on the topic  even if you dont directly address any of the specific situations i mentioned above   thanks  ,0.9957,381

1,what do you think about the guy when he is nervous and awkward while approaching you  everywhere it s said that women hate it when a guy approaches but is nervous awkward  however  i have this curiosity to know if that s true  for everyone   a little background   i am a less than average looking guy because of a snub nose  but take  care of my health and hygiene  i m good with social interaction  keep  making friends and do really well with clients  i m in consulting    saying this just to let you know that i m not awkward in general   one  thing which is a pain point for me is that if i have a crush on  someone  i cannot be the same confident guy when i m approaching them  for just saying hi  even if i know that they ve seen me being really  confident with other girls   here s  the reason i m asking this  there s a girl i had a huge crush on and i  kept catching her looking at me and we had tons of eye contact  it was  borderline crazy   but then i approached her to say hi when she was  alone and i was nervous  she definitely saw through it and went cold  after that  and i backed off   i  have been in a situation when i was talking to a girl who was nervous  and i really liked it  may be because i can relate to that and know that  it s genuine   so my question is   do all women get turned off for sure when the guy is nervous when he s  approaching for the first time  do they think  oh he s nervous probably  because he likes me    tl dr  what do you think about the guy when the he is nervous and awkward while approaching you  ,0.8683,309

1,do you believe past lives are real  have you had any experiences  if past life regressions are legitimate then all of the information i dredged up would indicate i was one of the oracles of delphi  asking here anonymously and in a room of female support and non judgement    asking anonymously in a room of women because this is personal and i work in a field where this will  frankly  be viewed very strangely by colleagues  i consider myself to be a grounded  well adjusted woman with a successful career  a committed husband and beautiful kids  and a lot of passion for my work  my mom is into the idea of past lives and so  out of pure curiosity  i tried a self hypnosis session just to see what happened  i m not sure what to make of it  and see if anyone has experienced anything like this    first  after a lead in of visualized relaxation the guy in the recording suggests you ask yourself a question that you d like to know about your past life  i ask myself  when have i been in a position of leadership when i ve been able to help the most people  i have no idea what i m going to see  but i m relaxed    and my eyes kind of flicker back and forth quickly under my eyelids  i m not asleep  but i see images and just kind of let them come to me   the first image i see is a of a purple flower  it s a sort of thick thistle with a bulbous stem and rounded top with points  ok  sure  the next thing that materializes is a man s face     this is where it gets crazy  i can feel anger building up in me and am so disgusted at the sight this man  tears slowly trickle down the side of my face  this man has a short beard and short curly hair  piercing eyes  and i know he is powerful  he is very  very powerful and has control over the lives of thousands and thousands of people that live down below  and he is cruel  i see these people  they are my people too  and i know they are suffering because of this man s decisions  they lack food and are struggling  all due to this asshole s poor decisions  greed  and mismanagement  this man listens to no one  except me  he listens to me because i am more powerful   i think about myself  who am i  i am a woman  i am pure  i am pure and no man can touch me  i think about where i am  i m sitting in a sort of sunken in stone rectangle inside an enormous open stone chamber  long prongs stick out  this is where i spend most of my time  there is another woman who spends time with me  who does what i do but is more junior  i am the most revered which is why that man only comes to me for advice  this other woman  she is my oldest son  i don t know how to explain it other than by the fact that i just know that she is the same person as my oldest son   more images and understanding of who i am comes to me  there are hallucinogenic drugs  and i take them  i take them regularly  i am encouraged to take these drugs  i am religious  i look down and see my dark red robe with gold stitching  it is my favorite robe  i am seen as in touch with higher beings  i am respected and my word is taken as word from the gods    there are snakes  live snakes  and their significance is important to who i am  these snakes are not poisonous  but are often around me  there are several big  long snakes around me  different types    i give advice  i know that the most important advice i give is to this asshole of a leader  i know how to manipulate this man and i am proud when this leader makes changes to spread resources to the people  so they have food  i am responsible for these changes because he did not want to do it but i made him  because of who i am   i know that i died of some sort of toxicity or poison  the toxicity built up in my body until i eventually died  i m holding white flowers that look kind of like lilies of the valley  as i die    a bit after this session i kind of doze a bit and then keep relaxed and thinking about all of these images and i decide shit  this is so strange  i m going to google this stuff and see what comes up  scroll scroll scroll  high snake priestess  scroll again and there it is  pythia of delphi the oracle of delphi  the series of priestesses who  over hundreds of years  occupied the role of the most powerful woman of the classic era   it all fits  the pythons and pythos  the hallucinogens  the temple of apollo  the advice given to powerful statesmen over hundreds of years  different emporers  some very cruel  like nero and caligula  i google image the landscape of the ruins at delphi  i ll be damned  one of the first images that pops up shows the ruins    and they are surrounded by thick  bristly purple thistles  they grow all around that area    i ve never been to greece  or had any sort of overt connection to the culture  i once took a course on ancient greece in college years ago  and that s literally the extent of my prior knowledge besides anything else i ve been exposed to in popular culture  i don t even remember having learned anything significant about the oracle of delphi in that course  and it certainly didn t stick with me all these years later    and that s it  as i said  i am not a person who would take this at face value and i still have my doubts at whether i am just imagining these things  one thing i can say  the emotions are very real  even now i can still feel anger and disgust towards this man when i picture his face  although it s been a day since  the anger has faded  but it s there  i have no explanation for these feelings     but yet  here i am  and somehow i think that  at one time in my past  may i have been one of the oracles at delphi  ,-0.9855,1094

1,women attracted to men  would you date a trans man  how about with little to no experience  i am a trans guy and consider myself to be exclusively heterosexual  ime  so far  anyway   i just posted asking for dating advice  mostly related to apps  in the  binary ftm  subreddit  a lot of my post revolved around a lack of sexual experience  but also relationships in general  due to dysphoria  but then it occurred to me  i could probably ask this here  here is a part of my post    gt most of my avoidance is due to the dysphoria around sex  but it just gets worse over time because then i start to doubt myself because of lack of experience  i actually confirmed that i was trans after a therapist that was trying to figure this out with me in high school suggested i try to imagine being sexual as both a man and a woman   with both men and with women  the only thing that clicked was with me as a man with a woman  but to this day  that is the only way i see myself doing anything sexual  so it is kind of a huge mental block   i have seen a lot of  would you date a trans man    and also  for that matter   would you date a virgin    come up both here and elsewhere on the internet  what often does not come up is the sex specifics  i guess people tiptoe around that a lot  i have seen a lot of  straight  women answering that they wouldnt be able to be in a sexual relationship with someone who is using female anatomy  need the sex to be piv  etc    what is ironic about this to me is that is the only way i have ever been able to see myself having sex or get turned on at all  which is what causes me so much dysphoria and avoidance of sex in the first place    before i transitioned  i think dysphoria has made me less interested in girl on girl stuff as well  because if i ever tried to identify with one of the girls i would get dysphoria to the point of being nauseated more than anything else  i am not even turned on by straight porn that involves a trans man and a cis woman  to be fair  in a lot of that  the trans men are sexually taking more of a female role  which is more of a turnoff   i cant imagine myself as them in the same way   so you see where that would be an issue    i refuse to do anything sexual unless i find a solution where it is essentially no different than a biological male  so far i havent found this solution and am still looking  i must be very picky  because a lot of the prosthetics and sex toys that work for many trans men just make things seem even more fake to me     not being able to father children also contributes to my dysphoria  and i hope that in my lifetime medical science finds a solution to this as well    so a more specific version of this question  would you date a trans man who requires being in a male  role  sexually  but because of this  also has little to no dating sexual experience  ,-0.7215,555

1,i have never told anyone the full story of me     m  and her     f  until now  but now i need some advice  everything started off  back in      when we both were on our first year at university  we went into different study programs  but we had classes in the same university buildings  when i first saw her  i was completely blown away by her  the way she walks  her looks  her style  her expression  you get the idea  i saw her occasionally on the floor and i found out later that she also noticed me  a couple of months passed  and i became good friends with someone that knew her very well and that was basically my gateway ticket for getting to know her personally  i took that chance and we got to know each other  from that point on we saw each other frequently also because there was exam season during that time  for about half a year we keep close ties with each other and would hang out regularly when we were doing stuff for our classes   now before i continue  i should mention that she is rather introverted and usually does not talk to guys at all  she needs to fully trust a person to express herself  regarding myself  i am a really outgoing person and i like to create positive vibes and bond with people  i have a basic level of trust for everyone and i generally try my best to give a positive outlook when i talk to people  we both had just   serious relationship prior of knowing each other  i had also some acquaintances  but they were just short flings that i do not consider worthy mentioning any further   we had a really good time together and i have to say that i didnt asked her out for a date yet because of her rather closed character and also because i have to get approval by her family first  especially by her bothers  which is really hard to get  we share the same cultural heritage and our culture makes is additionally difficult to just get things going on romantically  so i waited and continued to create a strong bond with her  i actually never have developed such deep feelings for someone except from that girl    i was attracted by her looks but i fell in love with her personality    she has by far one of the best personality and character traits i have ever seen in a human being   things were going great between us but on one day we were sitting next to each other and i thought she was feeling uncomfortable with me sitting next to her and i suggested her that i move places to give her some more space  boy have i been wrong  she actually liked sitting next to me as i realized later on but she took my suggestion completely wrong and afterwards started to hate me  and i felt that something was odd with her afterwards  she straight went to the bathroom and she cried there most probably  at this day i legit died emotionally  i was having a deep negative approach in my life  that could have easily been developed into a full blown depression  al the effort i had made prior to get to know her and gain her trust were gone in a matter of moments  through intervention of another common friend of ours  we were able to forgive each other   at that point i expressed her my feelings for and she said that she was not feeling the same way for me as i feel for her and she assured me that she no longer hates me  but what i strongly think is  that she felt the same way for me but she was too ashamed of herself to admit having feelings for me because of what had happened between us   for the sake of her letting in peace and for me trying to get over her  i cut the contact with her  we came across each other occasionally on the hallway  but we didnt talk with each other   last summer i graduated from college and she is now in her last year  my study program lasted   years and hers last     on december   th       i was entering the campus to visit some friends i still had there and then i saw her sitting alone in the cafeteria studying  i first went straight to pass her but i returned and moved towards her  because all in all that was the only thing i have been wanting for the last two years  apart from getting my degree  we had a conversation about our lives and caught up how things have been going for us so far  it just felt exactly like the good times we had when we used to hang out together while we were studying   i know this girl for over   years now and i know i should get over her but i just cant  ive already tried everything  there has been no week passing without me thinking of her at least once  i wasnt able to cope the same feeling that i have for her with the other girls i have been out so far and i think i never will  i have a good social life  i have a loving and caring family  i go regularly to the gym for   years now and i am currently employed and have a high salary  i should be really looking for my future but i just cant considering that she is not by my side   my question now are if i should try to contact her  and if so  how should i do that  i dont have her number since the time we had an argument  she recently deleted her instagram and i dont have an account on facebook  would it be considered creepy or even sick if i try to contact her  seemingly out of the blue  and should i finally tell her how i feel for her like i am telling you right now   tldr  i know a girl for   years and i now want to keep in touch with her again  after   years of no contact  we had an argument because of a misunderstanding  that we have resolved by now     months ago i saw her again and we had a nice conversation  i actually have never stopped having feelings for her since the day i first saw her and i was not able to get over her  regardless of what i did  what should i do now   i am really looking forward for your answers and suggestions  i am grateful for every advise that i could get  ,0.9983,1116

1,what is the answer to the riddle of why many women who can already get guys easily  do excessive body modifications  presumably to become more attractive  when it comes to men  regardless of how attractive they are considered to be  men very rarely resort to major body modifications compared to women  they usually just do regular grooming even if they arent traditionally attractive  i am not in any way implying its necessarily wrong to modify your body by this question  but i do see a paradox with body modification habits mostly from women  based on what ive heard before in random documentaries from some decent looking womens motivations for getting body modifications  to become more attractive   it seems that the reason for doing it appear to be much more often than not  totally unnecessary  i have my own thinking about this riddle  but i figure  why not ask a whole community of women  if any of you women who have gotten body modifications before could shed some light on your reasoning for doing it when there is no medical or health reason why and you are doing it purely for cosmetics  that would be very helpful  ,0.8741,196

1,i think a female voice might be what i need    m  this might end up being a bit long winded so sorry up front   so i have been with my girlfriend for    years and its great  i love her and she loves me  but    there it is  but    my interest in intimacy has declined to critical levels with her     now we have never had a exciting sex life  pretty mundane and to the point  and it never really bothered me in the past    in the last couple years however the conventional nature if the whole process of having sex has wore on me  and i know that sounds bad  but thats how it feel now  a process  now i have never directly compared her to past relationships sexually  because the love it true  however i cant lie that the sex was a lot more    oh  raw i guess  and im missing it  i feel like im missing out on something bigger then sex right now  not sure how to explain it but  i dont have perverse kinks  that are creepy  or painful  just id like more then missionary   we talk a good game when dinking or out partying  but that about it  talk   i would really like to open up or bedroom life  but i dont even know what i want and thats a problem  she has dropped very very buzzed hints she maybe could play with another female  but id be off limits  so i never pushed it  i would probably be ok if she wanted another male  maybe  she has never hinted and im not gonna bring that up lol i think about sex all the time and i find myself thinking about unfaithful ideas and i have done that in the past and it blew up in my face   im sure in her mind im not pulling my weight  ive tried to spice things up  i think  brought up the gopro idea and that got denied  ok no problem   i really want to do that  i mentioned porn  and toys  nothing yet  i could probably just slap one of her dvds she has tucked away with bad acting  and a half ass attempt at a story line and get away with it lol  not my style but hey once the action starts who cares about s  t dialogue  and a few other ideas along the way  now i could keep going and going here but then it just turn into a me complaining  and i bet who ever actually reads all this gets the idea   so there it is  i more just needed to get that out and i really am hoping that maybe some females have been in my shoes so i could get just your mind and how it effected you i guess   so sorry for the rambling  but that has been on my mind for some time and had no one i was able to talk to with out it hitting damn social media  ,0.929,500

1,i started an online sexy time box for couples after being raped at    years old  ama keeping my anonymity  like most women  im not looking to get the negative attention that comes from confessing to being a victim of rape   but for the other women who have been through this  and for those who seek to understand    i am    years old  i went to another country for a   day conference and didnt get much sleep during that time    i had a friend from my hometown living in that country  we met up for the first time in two years    i had just got done with a   day conference  i didnt get much sleep  and i was in a new country  so i was just exhausted and asked if i could take a nap while we were talking at his house  i wasnt being good company or conversation as my eyes kept closing    he said he would take a nap too  i knew he liked me  i know this is where i will seem not very smart to some people   and i also thought that we might be together  since we both go to each others countries often for work    while i was napping  and i half way woke up when he started touching me from the outside of my shorts  i had my clothes on  exercise shorts and a t shirt     i pushed his hand away  but he was stronger than me and moved inside my shorts now    i was still groggy  but woke up quickly now  i said   no  stop  no  no  no  no  stop it  im on my period  stop  are you even wearing a condom  stop  please   more times than i can accurately count    he didnt care  he just moved my shorts and underwear to the side  and then forced himself into me    i tried to move my hands and push him off  but im pretty petite      and     lbs   he just put both my wrists in one of his hands  and i was defenseless  i never had that feeling before  of not being able to move my hands  of not being able to take care of myself   one thing i am grateful for is my intelligence  i didnt want him to harm me after  so i didnt say anything  i just grabbed my phone  and secretly started recording with the voice recorder app on iphone  i started to get my bag  he was also silent   recorded on the voice recorder    me   why did you do that     he didnt say anything    me   i said no  i was napping  why did you do that to me     he didnt say anything    me   answer me  after talking about wanting to get serious with me and start a family one day  why would you do that     him   i didnt see it that way     me   what way     him   you said no  but sometimes that means yes     me   no means no  im on my period  what makes you think i wanted to have sex with someone for the first time like this    i left  cried  was found by two women  told them what happened  called the police  filed a report  spent    hours in interrogation  had a medical exam  my bloody vagina swabbed  photos taken of my naked body  took a prescription for    different medications to be taken   times a day  plus the morning after pill  and went home   physically  for the next seven days  i couldnt move  i was nauseous from the anti std medication  they warned me about nausea side effects  but i never knew nausea could be so painful  i was thinking itd be more like nausea when i got car sick   but that type of nausea is         the medications side effects nausea was        my fingers were shaking  my body hurt  i couldnt eat or drink  because it made it even worse  but i couldnt stop taking the medications either  i didnt want to have certain stds for the rest of my life   mentally  i was scared of the world  i felt like i couldnt trust myself to make judgement calls anymore  i felt that i couldnt take care of myself well anymore  i felt i couldnt trust anything  the world  for the first time  felt like it was filled with villains wanting to hurt me  i never thought that guy would have done that  who else am i foolish for thinking they would never abuse me  who can i trust   several weeks went by  and everyone who i ran into said i seemed different  i told no one  except for two of my best friends  i couldnt tell my parents  it would make them too stressed and sad  and theyre both recently diagnosed with illnesses  i didnt want to make their health conditions worse    i made my world small and protected myself from everyone   but now  its been months   i have  slowly  been reading books on respecting myself  on loving myself  on owning myself and living life to the fullest  i became stronger  although parts of me inside still need healing  i will say that i have grown to be a fearless woman  and a woman who should be feared  im strong inside now   one thing that really  helped me get better was the sexual abuse non profits out there  they saved me  they are amazing  i love them    even writing this in my office  i am tearing up thinking about the girl i was before they helped me  and how much better i am now  thank you  it feels so good not to feel helpless anymore   i loved the work the non profits did for me and others  and i want to use part of my life to help change the ideas and notions around sex   it might not change the whole world  but itll change part of my world  i have to do something   so  i made a sexy time box for couples   i think part of the problem with sex crimes is that the idea that one night stands are hot  that overpowering a girl who is saying no is hot  this  hollywood  hit songs  and advertisements  is wrong   im really tired of hearing about how hitting this or tapping that is seen as conquering a girl  and how thats supposed to be cool  thats lame  you bachelors are lame and bad at relationships  guys that cant keep a girl are losers  i really think that rapist are guys who cannot get girls any other way   good husbands and boyfriends  on the other hand  need more praise in society   it is great for a man to care about and be good to a woman  thats not just cool  its beautiful   i think sex is best for couples  for people in love  who have consented to and commit to each other   thats why i created a sexy time box for couples   we need to progress the idea that this is hot  its hot to make sure your girlfriend or wife is happy and having fun  its hot to take care of her needs as much as yours   it feels good for me to have made this side business that promotes womens pleasure and couples sexy time  the fact is  sex is a big driver for humans  and i want to do my part in making sure that energy is propelled in a healthy way in our society   especially now that i know first hand what it feels like for it to be done in the worst  most unhealthy way  it was so damaging  and the months of time in my life it took to recover is time ill never get back   anyways  creating an online sexy time box for couples has been really healing for me and my view on the world   for anyone else who has been raped and having trouble grasping reality or feel their perspective of the world is warped  i hear  you  i was there  ask me anything   and for anyone else who is curious about how i came to heal  ask me anything   if youre too shy to ask on here  i want to recommend that you call a sexual abuse hotline in your country  some of the best people ive met in my life   if you work for a sexual abuse hotline  thank you for what you do  ,0.9811,1385

1,do women really wanna date men who show emotions  i know  its      and almost every woman you ask would likely say yes  but would they really  from my experience and seeing other relationships  it doesnt seem to work that way  of course  being too whiny and emo can get too much for anyone regardless of the gender  but from my experience in dating  one rule that i have now is to never show emotions  sadness  depression  suicidal thoughts  anxiety  etc  infront of a girl i like   i can show my emotions to my guy and female friends because theyll be there to support me  but admit it  women wanna date men  someone whod be there for them  not the other way around  every girl i liked dated showed lack of interest once i opened up about my mental issues  and it seems to be the same for my other guy friends  really ask yourself  would you feel like youre dating the right guy if he cries into your arms  unless someone can convince my otherwise  ill always keep in mind to never show negative emotions towards someone i like   this is just a side note  but im the type of guy thats silly  sometimes childish and just like having fun  i dont bother being a steriotypical masculine guy and i noticed that thats something that puts girls off  now i do take responebilities  i live alone  work  study and when dating  care for my significant other  but still  it doesnt seem like me being myself would get attract a woman  ,0.9887,260

1,how to be clear with intentions i am a    year old male  i matched with girl on tinder a while and she was only     i know big age gap  although i found her attractive i was apprehensive about chilling with her because of the age gap and i have never talked to someone that young before    she invites me over to her house  moms at work   from the beginning i tried to make the interaction sexual   i was trying to let her know that i wanted to have sex  after some back and forth sex banter  she said she catches feelings easily and has tried to have casual sex without emotions and she cant   and kissing   it was obvious that she didnt just want sex  although after stating this she went and touched my bulge out of curiosity  we kissed a little more i went home and agreed to meet up with her a couple days later  she seemed very clingy and attached so i got cold feet  and blocked her on everything  so i thought   today she messaged me on whatsapp asking why i completely went ghost on her  i told i just wanted to have sex and thats not what she wanted so i blocked her  i really blocked her cuz i didnt want her blowing up my phone   she than says i should have been more blunt about it   because she was feeling me but she was too shy to say anything  which i think i bs given saying  i just want to have sex with you  isnt the nicest sounding thing  i thought i was being forward with what i wanted  and i only kept being sexual because her words didnt match her actions  i also didnt push to hard because i didnt want to feel like i was taking advantage of her  what should i do next time to be more clear  this happened like     months ago  i know im wrong for ghosting but how could i have made myself more clear  i was trying to keep the conversation away from relationships and all that talk   tl dr i chilled with a girl once  and ghosted her because all i wanted was sex and she didnt  she told me i wasnt blunt about what i wanted  but i thought i was  how do i avoid this confusion in the future ,0.0454,395

1,help i might have posted this somewhere else but i want to post it here because im desperate  sorry i need to clutter this subreddit with this  i just tought that most womens are good at comforting people so here i go  sorry        whats the point  this post will be long  and it will contain a little cursing since i think thats the only way i can really tell how i feel  here we start  my parents got divorced when i was   and i didnt really care about it much  never asked to my parents never asked anyone about it  im shy and my parents are akward so i never give a second thought about it  i just go on with my life and never think that its going to weigh in on me later on in life   im bad at making friends  whenever i make friends  the cycle will always be the same  meet someone im interested being friends with  pretend like i have things to relate with them  got tired of being fake  and we separate  easy  use rinse repeat  again    i never think twice about it and always do it again and again until reality hits  i have no real friends  and fake friends are just not doing it for me  so instead of doing things with people in real life i moved in to playing games in the internet  but the cycle there is just the same  meet someone  pretend like were in the same league  get tired being fake  they leave   i just need to accept the truth  i look like shit  i have no talents and my marketable features are    what  sleeping and eating   but thats not the worst part  remember when i said i never think twice about my parents separating  yeah now its weighing in on me  when im not doing anything i always think about it and get sad     my mother always tell me from a young age that she always got beaten by my dad  shes so frontal about it    does she never think that it would hurt my feelings  shes so frontal about things its always her her and her  it fucking hurts hearing the fact that she said my dad was a bad person  imean when she said that i was like   or    she still talks about it but now i just dont listen to her anymore  my mother tells me her problem like i can help and fix it  but i cant  you know that attitude when they say things and act like its fine but its not  like she always tells me that shes not jealous of her friends having a husband  but obviously she is jealous like  oh i cant hangout with  friend name  shes out with her family  she has a husband not like me  like what  what was that even supposed to mean  do you want me to  what  fucking look for a husband for you     my dad is less frontal but it also hurts when i see or hear my parents fight  my dad has no chills and he will get mad at some things  he always say that my mom is stupid and all that    he still stays in contact with my mother  ofcourse there is me and he still needs to pay for child support  but since my dad has a successful business  you know with money and fame comes great responsibility    except my dad doesnt he thinks hes the god and everyone is his slave    are you using the shower when he is showering  oh dont because the water on his shower is going to be slow and hes gonna scream on you  are you doing things your way  oh no dont you must do it his way  are you a human  oh no on his eyes youre a robot and you must stand by       oh did he said that he will do it  spoiler alert  hes not  oh did he said hes gonna wake up at    oh no hes gonna wake up whenever he wants and were gonna be late  but its okay because its him  but you shouldnt be late tho  he has the money you would have to go by his rules  okay i think you get the point by now  its just sad my dad evolved to this  my parents now   well my dad is with my his new wife  and the tention is not good either theres a rumour that hes cheating and hes going to get a new wife  he goes trough wife like rc cars goes trough batteries  not attractive anymore  just throw them away  they dont have feelings  right   my mom on the other hand  she said she found a new man and shes gonna move this is a direct quote btw  im going to move far away you wouldnt be able to see me  the man is norwegian or smthn like that but hes working in arab as a engineer in some kind of oil company  ive never met him and i dont want to see him  im not gonna let him even step in to this house  under the ownership of my dad   i always thinks about these stuff whenever im not doing anything  thats why i play computer games  keeps me distracted and i cant sleep if i dont have youtube on because the nothingness will make my mind venture out to the  nd world   i dont fit in with my friends because i just dont like they do things  kids my age have girlfriends and stuff  but i cant  i look like shit who wants to be with me   they hangout at starbucks drink coffee just for the grams  i dont like that    im better off making coffee at home for a fraction of the price there   they have the latest phone just so they can brag about it  but im using a what  i dont even know the model year   they wear expensive clothing that needs to match  while i just a basic old t shirt with normal trousers when im out  my cargo shorts are my brothers old one   its not like i cant afford to get things like that  i have the money  i work for my dad    i just put my money into things that different than my friends  i buy games instead of those things  but that doesnt matter  right  playing games at your home is bad and going out is good even tough youre probably smoking and doing drugs  im a pushover  people brag infront of me  how they can drive a motorbike to school  they race the motor bike  they think smoking is cool and all that stuff but i just keep quite and let them be  afterall i just want to go home and play games  i play games to pretend like im what i cant be  on the internet there will always be a place for you  doesnt matter if you look good or bad  youll always have a place on the internet  i play games alot that i won    from a competition a couple weeks ago  its not pure win tho  since most of the good teams were unable to play since their member are celebrating new year so they cant compete  its only    tho  still nothing for people to not think that im not just a fish in the sea  a drop in a rain  a sand in the beach   kids my age have girlfriends and boyfriends  but i never really understand the logic behind that    why love someone now whos gonna hurt you later on  why dream when youre gonna wake up to reality  dream higher fall harder i say    why have a crush on someone who will probably never notice you  or there is no one that fits me since my hobby of computer is a little on the expensive side for kids my age       so the only time i like someone is people on the internet  i feel like people in love are dumb and blind  not gonna blame them since thats what love do to you  they break up and try to get back together just to break up again and get hurt twice  a broken glass will not be as strong as new when its fixed   thats why i love my computer  little maintenance  no feeling  works       plug it in and press the power button  can do alot  play me games  sing me song  tell me facts  show me videos    doesnt care if i look good or not  its just the best   i just dont know why no one have ever fit me  im not a brat  even tough my dad is wealthy i never show people what i have    like i said i wear cheap t shirt and stuff  tough i wear glasses and watch that costs a bit of money  it doesnt really show  i try to be as same as them as i could  i have a driver but i always tell him to park a little far so they cant see that i have a driver  i just dont get it  whats wrong  the only people that care about me is people on the internet       i say sorry almost always everyday because im always scared they would get offended and move away from me like they always do  its almost like i have a trauma of friends leaving me   its just sad that no one knows about this but no one can know  im asking for help while no one can help   i know many many people have had a harder teen than as ive been quite lucky that i always get anything i wish for  but that also makes me sad when i reality check  material things never makes me satisified  i want to be wanted  i want to feel like someone appreciate me existing  people on the internet makes me feel like im a part of something  i want the love i never get    but  its just i need to accept the truth but i cant  like i just want to get out of this phase and live with the people i love but im afraid that it will be many more years till that actually happens  but does it have to be like this until then  i genuinely feel not right like  will i be able to achieve things  not like material achivement  have a house get a good job or like that  imean by having the love i want and being surrounded by my loved ones one day in the future    sorry i would have to be in your day and this subreddit  hate me all you want and if you think that this is irrelevant you can just delete it but please dont hate me im sorry     tl dr i just want to be wanted  thats it  someone who cares about me and have the same interest so we can play games together    ,0.9994,1831

1,getting gift  clothing  for sister  need advice  figured here was best  alright this is kind of a  fashion  question in a sense as its in regards to clothes  but it didnt fit with the other subs i looked at  which is more current trends and such  which this question is not about   also i am a guy so this is more or less completely foreign territory to me  and this is probably not the most common scenario for reasons i will state  anyway my sisters birthday is coming up  and decided i should get her some clothes  i know a gift card covers whatever  but i dislike giving out gift cards since i feel an actual item means more  since all she ever seems to get as an indulgence is clothes and art related things  the later of which i already picked out    amp  x   b   anyway  with the scenario out of the way  ill get on to the clothes question  the reason i am on askwomen is because i have never had to buy womens clothes  when i get mine its just merely grab something that looks like it fits and is good to go  but when i looked at womens clothes it was apparently way more complex  she always wears loose tops  likely a size s  larger then normal  like t shirts so it was pretty easy to find one of those with art she would like on it  but the problem is with pants      amp  x   b   now before i continue  my sister is big  but not  no offense meant  fat  her height it between average and gwendoline christie         and her body matches the height  so not merely tall  and because womens clothes suited to that kind of body are quite rare  she just wears mens clothes most of the time since its much easier to find fitting ones and there is nothing socially unacceptable about it these days  she is not someone who follows current trends or anything like that  but she really loves  pretty jeans  though  been that way ever since she was a kid   that being ones with things like embroidery rhinestones etc   i have no idea if that is what hey are actually called or not  and she has a couple pairs that she managed to come across over the course of   years   that actually fit her  they were found in things like used clothes shops  so where they come from i dont know  they are pretty much her favorite clothes she has  and i thought she would really love actually getting another pair from me    amp  x   b   now normally i would ask for more details  the problem is either the questions would give away the gift  or i might sound like a weirdo  so im trying to kind of keep it on the down low  i do sort of have measurements  essentially reverse checked some clothes she didnt want and gave to me to go to the good will or whatever  because they were  slightly too tight    i checked custom tailors  but they lack the option for the so called  pretty jeans  features  and all the ones you can find on the usual sites go up to around       which i know is too small  she is not fond of plus size due to them  having a bunch of extra room  since  again  no offense  they are made for the hefty  so i guess the best description of what i am looking for  would be normal jeans that go above size     seems to be the most common biggest that arent plus     amp  x   b   i know this is kind of a crazy question to ask  but i wasnt sure where else i could  and i assume every woman here has clothes shopped at some point  and this would  i am      sure  be a       gift and mean much more than a gift card  if there are any sort of key words or whatever to search when doing this thing i am unaware of  literally my knowledge of clothes shopping is limited to  mens  lt insert article of clothing gt     anything is appreciated  or even if someone has maybe a better idea they want to bring up    amp  x   b   below is a visual of what constitutes  pretty jeans     amp  x   b    https  imgur com dhcrkp  ,0.9985,722

1,yeast infection tyranny  any suggestions  about two months ago i started having a yeast infection after sex  and the symptoms were so mild that i just ignored it for about two weeks  it suddenly flared up  i got tested and had candida    was relieved to be prescribed what had previously used and worked beautifully    diflucan  except this time it definitely didnt work  i took four pills over the course of eight days and had zero such luck  was on vacation in a foreign country and was able to find a three day treatment of clotrimazole  which also didnt work   got back home and my doctor prescribed me two weeks of terconazole  which made my symptoms mellow down almost completely  with minor flair ups here and there  hoping i could vanquish this thing completely  i went to the obgyn  she ordered a culture which came back negative  to think i was in the clear  and she prescribed me a seven day treatment of boric acid pills to clear things up and prevent reoccurrence   sadly after two nights of using boric acid  my symptoms started flaring up completely again  im not sure if this was just an inevitable result of the infection never being completely cleared or the boric acid actually causing it  but it was super disappointing nonetheless  i continued to use the boric acid for the next few days hoping it would bounce back  to no such luck    after finishing that treatment  i went back to my obgyn and she said  go to the store  buy the three day treatment of monistat and use it once a week for three weeks  side note  i saw my primary care doctor the same day for separate  long standing cold symptoms  she prescribed me antibiotics with diflucan on the side in order to clear any resulting yeast infection  i didnt even bother telling her that i already had one  so my obgyn recommended i take those two diflucan pills three days apart  while also using the monistat as she suggested   i took the monistat  the first one  and the first diflucan on friday and its now sunday     symptoms are still pretty present  itching  burning    not the worst that ive had it but certainly not super comfortable    its been almost two months since the infection first flared up and im just starting to lose it and think i have to live with this thing  i have a week left of boric acid pills that the pharmacy supplied me and im wondering if i should try them since it seems i have nothing to lose  does anyone have experience with boric acid not working    im disappointed because everyone else on here has said they work like magic     any advice would be super helpful  ,0.9935,458

1,need guy advice   i need advice on guys  recently i went to canada to go and visit family friends with my mom and my brother  there are three guys and they have always acted like cousins to us  one guy who is    has always been close to me i m     during winter break me and him were watching netflix in a twin bed and he put his arm around me  after he put his arm around me and my mom walked into the room and yelled at us on how this is not lady like on my behalf  she left the room and later i pause the movie because of the awkward tension between us  my mom pulled him aside without me knowing and asked him if he liked me  he said he didn t know his feelings towards me in that way  the next day at night he asked my brother if he wanted to watch tv  my brother said no because he was tired so when the    year old walked past me i suggested we could watch netflix  earlier that day it was his birthday and he got a new phone  so i said i could help him set it up before we watch netflix  i sat on his bed waiting for him to get changed into comfy clothes in the bathroom  after a while everyone in the house fell sleep and i asked him if we were still going to watch netflix  he said yes and put on a new movie for us to watch  we watched the hunger games  his arm was uncomfortable so i suggested he put his arm around me  he sat there for a while and i told him i wanted snacks  i told him to come with me because i had to walk all the way downstairs and it was dark  after we got snacks we went upstairs and he sat on the inside of the bed closest to the wall and he got mad because he s bigger than me  i told him that i should lay on the outside because i was gonna go to bed soon  when he went to lay on the inside of the bed he put his arm on the pillow  so when i would lay down his arm would be behind me  he put his arm around me without asking me  after    minutes he slid his arm down my waist and kept it there  i put my head on his chest and we watched the movie for an hour  i got tired and suggested that i should go to bed  he told me that i should stay longer because we were both comfortable  i told him i had to go to bed because i was tired and we were gonna wake up early the next day to hang out with family  when i went back to my room i did not know what just happened  the next night he asked me if i wanted to watch netflix  at this point i do not know if he likes me or not because i didn t think anyone would act this way towards someone they don t like  he had his arm around my waist  we were comfortable with each other  expected that i was most likely going to go to bed and he wouldn t argue for me to stay longer  i went to bed at   am and we both had to wake up at   am to go skiing  while we were skiing i fell down and he picked me up  to make sure i wouldn t fall down again he put his arm around my waist  he asked me if i wanted to do it an all nighter  he later fell asleep because he was tired from skiing all day  i woke him up and asked if he still wanted to watch netflix and he said yes  he later fell asleep  the next day i told him why didn t he stay awake so we can watch netflix because it was my last night there  he said i was supposed to wake him up again and got mad at me  the day we went skiing was my last day in canada and i was leaving the next day so it was our last chance to cuddle and watch netflix  i like him and i don t know if he likes me back i m scared to tell him how i feel if he doesn t like me back  do you guys think he likes me or not  ,0.9014,762

1,safety tips for a woman who will be watching a ranch  likely  alone for nearly a month in a rural area  warning  this is a very long and detailed post   hello everyone   i know the title may raise red flags regarding my decision to do this  though i m only seeking support and tips to help me feel as prepared as possible  please and thank you all very much    the details   i am a single woman in my mid    s watching my uncle s ranch in a rural area for about    days by myself   states away from home  i had a friend who was going to stay with me for a chunk of that time  though that doesn t seem likely now  he has about    dogs and a lovely pig who all sleep in the house with him and his wife  in that sense  i have a feeling of security  in addition  he has a variety of animals both large and small in the ranch that i ll be with and responsible for during this time    i have one major concern about this trip  their neighbor  the land is very spacious  so much so that i can barely see his home  though his friendship with my uncle has him coming around very often  he is in his late    s  a bit stout  and he lives with his mother who he cares for all day  which seems to be the primary thing keeping him occupied  from my past visits  he has made me feel uncomfortable at certain times and has made himself look relatively obvious to even my father and his girlfriend  he has a dog who hangs out at my uncle s all day with the others  i feel that he d use this as an excuse to show up unannounced  he seems  too  comfortable coming around freely    though i haven t felt particularly threatened by him  i am very concerned about the idea of being potentially alone on this property for this long and feel like i need to prepare for the worst   perhaps this seems like a foolish decision  though i am going to move out later this year to the state i ll be in at the ranch late march  and i have the opportunity to check out apartments in which i ll be living alone in for the first time  they are paying me a huge sum of money which could help me potentially secure myself a place during this time  they are providing me with a car to drive  there are also more on the property that are functional   and they ve paid for my round trip ticket  i want to take advantage of the opportunity and be able to feel confident and secure in my ability to take every precaution i can to be safe  i am still in search of at least one person to stay with me for a portion of this time    further details about the property and surrounding area   the two homes that my uncle has on the property and wooden structures for all of the animals are all pretty close to each other  with the property beyond stretching quite aways  it s a medium large plot of land with wire fencing   there are two homes on the property  the guest home is newly built  the main house is two stories and much older  there is a porch light that i believe is motion sensitive  and my uncle s talkative companion best friend parakeet who is either going to be on my shoulder all day and then in his cage at night  there is no way i wouldn t know if someone was approaching    i am a      minute drive from the main grocery store  gas station  and other small businesses of the small town  the landscape is relatively mountainous  though we are at a much lower altitude  basically at the base alongside a shallow river   mainly  i am looking for tips on how to secure both homes  particularly the one i ll be in with farmhouse wear and tear  prepare myself within the home  weapons short of guns like tasers  wasp spray  etc   and other strategies to optimize a feeling of safety and security  i have until march   rd to prepare accordingly   i also would like tips on how to repel this person as best i can and draw hard boundaries without provocation if possible  i am open to suggestions from any of the experiences you have had thought of believe are relevant and helpful to this  though i want to keep things realistic and practical    i want to stress that i am not trying to inflate or exaggerate the situation  perhaps there isn t much to worry about  though of course i can t not think of the worst  especially with the instances of feeling uncomfortable  unfamiliarity  and further context i need not mention  so i m prepared just in case     if there is any more i can add  please let me know  once again  thank you all in this community in advance for taking the time to read this and possibly respond  i appreciate your support   ,0.9972,858
1,how do i stop thinking about sex  horny all the time  need advice  okayyyyyyy   so i    f  am in a relationship with a guy    m   let s call him  k   i ve been with him since an year  things have been pretty good with us  we re head over heels for each other and i m quite happy and satisfied with that  the only thing that has bothered me while all this time is my sexual urges  i think about sex all the time  i have all these sexual fantasies in my mind that i want to do but k on the other hand has low sexual drive    in the beginning  everything was okay  we used to have sex all the time but then things changed and now since past three months  his libido has relatively decreased and it s been so frustrating for me  i want to have lots and lots of sex  i ve talked about this to him several times  but nothing has changed  it has come to a point where i start fighting with him over this and feel like having sex with someone outside instead of being with him    and yeah  my constant frustration has also led me to masturbate a lot of times and he is not aware of it    one more thing  i m young and i want to do crazy stuff whereas k is not as adventurous as me  i want to explore a lot of things but he doesn t feel like it    i really don t know what to do  i love him  i love him so much but i just cannot control my sexual urges  i ve read some posts here  numerous people have suggested me to focus somewhere else or find a hobby  tbh  i work   hours every day and have stuff to do sometimes when i come back home  besides this i still feel horny all the time and i really need some help  ,0.9613,327

1,nearly all of my online dating interactions are super scary and i think im developing trauma from it all after a year  have you had similar experiences  ive tried okcupid  bumble  tinder and local sites  and most men just come across as extremely pushy  entitled  arrogant and creepy  demanding to meet immediately  usually in a shady place even   requiring naked pics or very quickly being sexual  and whenever i say no and try to slow them the fuck down  they continue insisting and threaten to stop talking with me  so i instantly block them   im a trans woman and im open about that in my profile so as not to waste time  a lot of people still dont read my profile though  but when i do make them aware of it myself  they instantly change the conversation towards the aforementioned directions   so i guess most men do not see me as anything more than an easy lay or someone probably desperate enough to sext with them   get naked pics from and then to be blocked   but this really makes me start to distrust men in general   what if someone were once really good at hiding their true colours and id eventually get assaulted or worse  i always meet strangers only in well lit and crowded public places and tell my friends where im at  but yeah   if most do not seem to care at all about respecting my boundaries  nor me as a person in general   i am mainly wondering if others on here also have similar experiences or if it has more to do with me being trans  ,-0.6558,269

1,looking for advice or experience about prenup clauses i am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this question in  my partner and i have been together for several years and have a child  weve thinking about getting married   this will be his second marriage and my first   and he wants us to sign a prenup  he has children from his first marriage and significant assets and inheritance that he wants to protect  he wants the agreement to state that each of us waive any right to spousal support  alimony  pension  life insurance and such  he also wants the agreement to state that any income and property each of us earns or buys in the future be separate and the other not stake a claim to it  while i have no problem with him keeping whats his coming into the marriage  i feel like its unfair to me to keep everything separate while we are married  particularly if we stay together for years and then divorce   for some background  were in mid late   s  he earns  x more than i do and we live in a house that he owns  he is a citizen while i have a residency sponsored by my employer  we currently manage our finances separately and while he pays for the utilities  i pay for everything else   schooling  child care  groceries and all other household related expenses  i contribute as much as i can   almost everything i earn goes for the above and as a consequence  i dont have much money to save at the end of the month  i have no debt  some savings in    k and an    k emergency fund   but not much else  i will inherit my parents house  but that is in my home country  assuming i continue to contribute at this rate  i will not have much more in terms of savings several years from now   my concern about his prenup agreement is that it will lock me in  even if we decide to jointly buy assets together  which i cannot currently afford   he thinks it should be split based on how much each of us put in  irrespective of the number of years we are together as husband and wife  while i think this is unfair  i am not exactly clear on what  fair  constitutes  i feel that it doesnt take into consideration that this is supposed to be a partnership  i am an independent  self made woman  but i am also very much aware that this might change as i age  i will not stake a claim on what belongs to his children and do not expect a       split   not even close  but at the same time  i feel that if we are together for a long time  he should have some consideration for what i am left with  if he decides to divorce me    years from now  i will have to more or less start from scratch   can any of you ladies give some advice on this  i would like to propose some clauses  but unsure what they should be  ,0.7778,515

1,advice needed about a relationship with a nerd hi  please some advice would be so welcome  i lived abroad and things got so bad and had no support while diagnosed with mental illness from stress  this made it worse as could not form relationships after with men thinking i am now a mad person and also had panic attacks  the only madness i have had was really so much existential stress from a traumatic break up  bad accommodation and jobs as i am an artist   that i could not take any more stress  returned to my parents and found it suffocating after    years  leaving my career behind  now am home and need also a surgery and fix teeth etc plus i cannot really work until the surgery is done and also need to work on self to eliminate panic attacks  i jumped into a sort of relationship with a man who i used to work with and he is a nerd  he was offering to help me and has been a great listener plus was buying me things like shoes which is did not ask for plus a phone etc and also offered to pay for my surgery  i very much want to get on my feet asap so i can be a working individual and what he is giving me is suffocating me  though i need the help  i am staying with him now as have panic attacks and is easier for me to be in town where he is now  yet the vibe got weird when a long time passed and we did not have sex  i wanted to try but i felt ackward and confused not knowing what i want  anyway we had sex and ever since he is constantly invading my space and even though i told him i cannot help anyone right now he becomes too clingy if we do have sex and i feel ackward about going to see friends as he joked and was even serious from the very start that he wants to marry me  he spent years alone and now i feel he could be too possessive over me  we had plans to see how we get on as he wanted to move abroad too and i would  help him  he has got a good job and it feels as if i have to trap myself with a man because i would be unable to go abroad again to start as a waitress because of my health  he creeps me out sometimes because i feel he is so aware of everything i am doing i feel i cannot have a romantic relationship with him  if we moved abroad i would say he would be jealous if i made a life in artistic circles which is time consuming  i feel i don t want to be some kind of gold digger and be with him just cause he offers stability and financial support if needed  all i wanted was to fix my health and be able to do any job  i can feel he is creeped out right now cause i am ignoring him  ever since we had sex he was issuing every chance to have his hand in my pants during any conversations  this put me off and now i get a vibe he is sulking  giving me space though he is so acward  he is     i feel like i have no energy to help him with personal development as i am dealing with own issues  ,0.3775,585

1,tips for making my girls first time less painful and more enjoyable  hello everyone  my girl and i are planning on having our first time sometime this month  she has been overseas for winter break and i think she wanted to do it the night  monday or tuesday  she got back but i want to move it towards the weekend so we can get back into the groove and i dont want it to feel forced by giving it a schedule fixed date  we are each others first sexual partners  all weve done so far is given each other head but it was a new experience to both of us  weve also experimented with a lot of foreplay and dry humping as well  she loves getting on top and grinding against my bulge    ive given her head     times and ive been able to make her orgasm each time  the last time being the most intense  im not really worried about things being awkward or anything like that because we are very open and communicative and we are also non judgmental  communication is also a decent amount of the reason i was able to help her reach climax because she would tell me what she liked and didnt like  if i needed to be more gentle or if it hurt  she would let me know  the main times it hurt was when i tried to stick my tongue inside and when i tried to stick my finger inside one time  she said it hurt so i just went to back to eating her out    she wants to do it but she is really worried about the pain and i am really worried about putting her in pain too  she enjoys getting head a lot and i love giving it but im not sure how much that will help overtime in terms of making the first time less painful except for foreplay purposes  the one time i tried to put my finger in she said it hurt so we stopped but if thats a part of the steps we should be taking to make penis in vagina penetration less painful then i think it would be worth it in the long term and thats a discussion i would like to have with her in that case    in terms of positions  ive heard doggy style for the first time is a no no lol  i wasnt planning on it but i will definitely be making sure it wont happen now   i would also like to look into non irritating safe lube that we could use with latex condoms as well if you guys recommend it   thanks in advance all   also  just to clarify  im not expecting the first time to be amazing and i dont think she is either  i just want to be as gentle and prepared as possible because i want it to be something we can both enjoy  if its a slow process that may take a few attempts days then its fine with me  i just want to make sure im doing things properly  ,0.9939,515
1,keeping unexpected pregnancy  not sure how to process wifes decision  x post from r relationship advice to get variety in my feedback   my wife and i recently discovered she was pregnant  she is overjoyed by the discovery  she  f    has a health condition that makes it difficult for her to have children  and previously miscarried a child in a previous relationship  she has been concerned that her age and a family history of uterine cancer would make it even harder  and is relieved to have the opportunity to be a mother  furthermore  she recently got a stable well paying job  and we are in the middle of moving to a bigger apartment  so things are in a relatively good place for us   i  m    am less enthusiastic  i am interested  ultimately  in fatherhood  but i am younger  and hadnt considered it for the present for several reasons  she was in medical school out of state for most of our relationship  and so the past few months are the first time really that weve been able to spend extensive time together as a couple  i had hoped to enjoy that time where it could just be us a before we took that leap  furthermore  she has a lot of difficulties  story for another day  that result in my needing to take care of most aspects of her life outside of work for her  this includes all the housework  managing her finances  medical stuff  etc  i work from home  and i am finding that the stress of managing a second adult and being solely responsible is impacting my work significantly  i have been working with my wife to improve our dynamic to ease that stress  but it takes time to enact change  i can see how this pregnancy could result in further lopsided responsibilities  i work from home  so theres an expectation for me to take charge in childcare thats hard to deny is logical  lastly  while her job pays well  we live in a a very high cost living area  los angeles west side   we would have trouble affording a child  its possible we will have to move again as soon as the lease ends  possibly to another cheaper city   as soon as we got the news  she let me know that she was not interested in abortion  and dismissed my concerns when i shared them  i put together my thoughts over the next few days  when i told her i wanted more bonding time she said  well  you have   months   i talked to her about my work life struggle  and she suggested i end my career to be a full time parent  i told her that i would like to be a father but that this wasnt a good time  and she took away  i dont want to be a father  from it and made me feel guilty for wanting to  take this chance from her    im having trouble processing how quickly she came to that decision without a discussion  and am upset with how my participation was an afterthought  despite feeling this disproportionately effects my wellbeing  at this same time  i know that her concerns are valid  and that being made to abort the pregnancy would be a devastating blow psychologically that would effect our relationship  i dont believe in policing womens bodies  regardless of how i feel  shes entitled to wanting to be a mother  and i cant force her to abort  and while i do feel its not a good time  were certainly in a better position than many new parents   my head has been a mess the past week  i feel numb  and i dont know how to move forward  i tried going online to find some perspective  but could only find the opposite scenario  man wants child  wife aborts   i would really appreciate some advice  anecdotes and perspectives one way or the other   we have already agreed that we should get counseling to work on our issues  individually and as a couple  ,0.9825,667

1,would you be offended if a guy approached you  you hit it off  but he didnt ask for your number  i dont want to go into too much detail  but theres a girl that ive seen a few times  and today it turned out to be just her and i  i find her extremely attractive  thought this was the perfect opportunity  and so i decided to approach her  everything was going great  she was obviously into me  and i started to like her too  but i decided to not ask for her number in the end  why  during our conversation she revealed that she just had a kid and that was a deal breaker for myself  im sure she figured out why i didnt ask  but i wonder how you would feel in that situation   i didnt ask because a  i wanted to respect whatever situation shes got going on  and i didnt want to disrupt it for the sake of lust  b  i took her telling me as a hint as to what shes got going on personally  and c  i wasnt interested in being just friends so i saw no purpose in going beyond acquaintances  in the end  i could tell that she was happy that she met me  but i could also tell that she was surprised i didnt ask for her digits   i get the sense that shes still flattered  and she gained respect for myself for thinking with my head and not only my dick  she seemed happy about the interaction  i am too  but im just curious what a girls perspective on this is  would you be happy that a guy simply took interest in you  ,0.997,282

1,how early did you feel pregnancy symptoms for your first pregnancy  hi  i m going to start off by saying that i m     and have been pregnant once before by my boyfriend at the time that ended in miscarriage  i remember feeling more sweaty when i was pregnant  and as a person that hardly sweats unless i m working out that was an odd sign for me   i also remember feeling really hungry  alll the time  those were my only two real signs  though      fast forward a few years later  and i m wondering if i m in the same boat again  i have been hooking up with my fwb for months now  and we use condoms religiously  last week or the week before  one of them broke and i figured that s cool  this is why i m on the pill in case this happens  that and my period was so irregular so taking the pill worked  so everything was cool again  until it wasn t  my fwb and i met up for new year s eve  and instead of doing the deed as always  we both fell asleep  i felt so tired for whatever reason    the next morning  at about six am i m still asleep but i can feel his hard on behind me  he put it inside   consensual of course  and he asks me if i m on the pill   i am   we have this amazing sex  and in my mind i think he s gonna pull out just in case but he doesn t and i m thinking that s ok i m on the pill   i m half asleep still by the way  after we both rolled back over i realized that week i had forgotten to take a pill  and didn t have the heart to tell him because he would ve told me i was stupid for forgetting and why not tell him when he asked  but in all honesty it hadn t hit me until after we did it that i had forgotten  i was too caught up in the moment to think with my stupid brain that i had a slip up that week  a few days later  and i m feeling this intense stomach pain along with chills  sweating profusely like my last pregnancy  and projectile vomiting  i thought it was food poisoning but my brother ate the same thing as me when i saw him and felt fine  my fwb asked me if i thought i could be pregnant  i said no way  after all i only missed a pill  then i remembered the condom breaking   i think it s way too soon to tell  but i m wondering if any of you had gotten this sick in your early pregnancy  i threw up maybe     times today  this was also completely on accident as far as ttc  if i am expecting but i stand firm with thinking it s so soon to know  i m scared to take a pg test  also please don t judge me for all this  i realize i deserve what ever outcome  ,-0.9244,519

1,just found out my  f    boyfriend  m    of   years has been actively pursuing others okay  firstly i am new here and on mobile  so i m sorry if formatting is weird or wrong  also  this is a throw away account for obvious reasons  i want to preface that this man is the love of my life  he s a wonderful boyfriend and always has my back  we talk about our future often  he talks about marriage often too    i currently feel sick writing this   okay  so this all started on reddit actually  my boyfriend supposedly didn t have social media  later found out he logs into his  old and unused  twitter and instagram accounts occasionally  god only knows what s on there  will delve into in a min  other than reddit  and i recently started using reddit  i wanted him to show me how to use reddit  on his app  i hadn t downloaded it yet   and also see what subreddits he follows  just out of genuine curiosity  and wanted to lightly roast him if there were funny weird ones but didn t really care  and he was super against it  like defensive almost  so finally  i convinced him to just open the app so i could see wtf was going on  obviously a red flag was going off in my head  but since i didn t really know how to use it i couldn t properly stealth  he said the reason he was being defensive secretive with his reddit was because he follows porn accounts  nsfw accounts  i m like okay  i honestly don t care if you do  it doesn t bother me that you follow those  so  i looked at his reddit a few days later  by then i know how to navigate and stealth properly   just to see what he was commenting on some of his interests  i am a twitter gal  so i was thinking looking at his page would be similar to doing it on twitter  like seeing funny stuff  so  here s the hilarious part  i see his comments on a post that he deleted  asking for purse recommendations for a girl he was dating  and that he s going based off of her usual insert specific purse description that she apparently always carries for her taste  not only do i not own a bag at all similar  i hate purses  and hardly ever use them  and would definitely not like one as a gift which he knows  so  i asked him about this  he said it was for his step sister  and even showed me a screen shot of a snapchat exchange between them discussing it   i brushed it off  i mean it s his step sister right  so because i am now weirded out and paranoid  i go through his phone  i know  trust and all that but like    come on  he said he d be willing to spend      on this bag for her  when he s been complaining to me the past month about having money problems  so i go full f b i  mode  i m talking the full   yards  i find some other deleted posts that say he s legitimately interested in someone from work  that he s interested in whoever he s buying the purse for  definitely separate people   and  after searching through his messages  apparently he gave his number to a women he met at a bar   i m so upset  i don t even know how to proceed  this is someone that yesterday i thought i would spend the rest of my life with  who my entire world revolves around  my best friend  and another weird shitty thing is he s constantly telling me he would never want to do anything to mess our relationship up  how much he loves me  he wants to marry me  etc   and  i once brought up the topic of open relationships  we started dating at     and it was something i wanted to discuss because he hadn t dated anyone before me and i didn t want either of us to feel unfulfilled or whatever down the line  and he completely shut down even the prospects about discussing it  he said that i was all he ever wanted needed  and he didn t want to see me with anyone else  etc   okay  i know that was long  i don t know what to do from here  ,0.9961,736

1,i m feeling brave   but as part of my resolve for the new year i might as well go with it   why do some women alienate other women when they discover a potential friend is a lesbian  i come in peace  no judgment  no insults  no stereotypes  what can be done to clear the air   i mean with some  i know it s competitive projection  like with some women  a lot would outright ignore you or avoid you if you re attractive or they find you a threat  even for friendships  or will find a way to make your life miserable or sabotage your ambience because another woman could take away from their spotlight  if they have a husband or boyfriend or male acquaintance of any sort they try to make you look bad so they look better  we get it  but when they figure out one is a lesbian and not interested in their men  it s like some weird shit gets into their head  all of a sudden  they think you want them  which is annoying because ironically i haven t found myself attracted to straight women  but that s more of an attitude thing that they usually have in common more than anything  some of you know what i mean  a different programming  there s definitely some women out there that know they just want men  all women know or seem to acknowledge that our collective as a gender is so different  but more on that at another time  but with plenty of others it s kind of annoying and even frustrating  they act like also a sudden you ll fall for everything with a vagina  which isn t how attraction works  or that you have some kind of disease  and the men become mosquitoes  if they backed off before now they feel they have something to prove  especially if you re not alternative presenting  or insult our looks  as if lesbians don t want to be attractive to other lesbians because we don t want men  well some of us  respect the variances   and i ve gotten this from a lot of straight women and men and even some bisexual women  all of a sudden if i m a lesbian  i ve got to alter my looks  make myself invisible even  all of a sudden everyone s an expert on your love life and wants to judge  even though most straights i know have messy love lives and marriages etc  i mean no one regardless of gender or sexual orientation is immune to those either but wow  i don t know but sometimes i feel like i m the only one going through this dilemma  no one seems to bring the change in decorum  i don t know  maybe because i have never found myself jealous of anyone or anything  or find myself feeling insecure of myself  i was raised to accept myself as i was whatever i was or looked like and to consider myself blessed because a lot have less  my parents said don t complain about how i look  instead to play with it and display it to their best advantage  to celebrate myself as well as others  not to demean myself or anyone  my parents are pseudo philosophical hippies  they always abided by the rules  do on to others as they do onto you  and are extremely idealistic  both introverts  reserved folks  and serial monogamists  we weren t rich  we struggled a few times  but ultimately my parents  value system was to always be good people regardless  we were the rich that weren t rich if that makes sense  or thirsty for it or what seems to move most people  heck my entire families on both sides are like that  happy  respectful  people loving hippies  it hasn t gotten us rich  but we re not really striving for rich  for us wealth is health  fun  great teeth and respect  not being corny that s the family value system  we were far from broke  but we re happy  growing up  or having grown up  i find myself seeing that a lot of people aren t very nice at all  selfish and inconsiderate often  i don t know  but am i wrong to think that their response is unfounded  i know i m being maybe a little naive but i ll be honest sometimes it s kinda painful  i find myself feeling like an alien in this  love is a battlefield  type of life  again  i come in peace  i felt that i should ask this not to just lesbians but other women as well  please be respect and kind and if i offended you  i m genuinely sorry as that s far from my goal  i seek understanding  please  thank you and i truly wish you all the best  ,0.9995,806

1,working moms on netflix confirmed the negative picture of motherhood i ve always thought about in general  i ve never been interested in having kids but i always thought my opinion would eventually change the older i get  only    atm  but i started watching working moms on netflix  granted i m only on season one  but it s reeeealllly leaving a bad taste in my mouth     the show is funny don t get me wrong but all characters make motherhood really look like a burden and they all have very different life situations and backgrounds which is why i m a little flipped out i guess but i instantly saw myself in kate and to see her deal with shit from every angle seems to have confirmed my thoughts on how having a kick ass career is expected to be put aside to have  raise kids and if you don t and continue to focus on career growth  you face backlash in various forms    ever since i was a little girl i ve dreamed of climbing the corporate ladder and providing for myself as lavishly as i could imagine and    years later  i work as an options trader in ny and have built a very solid foundation to a promising and fulfilling life and career with help from no one but myself      i just can t imagine putting years of work on hold and having to be expected to automatically be fine with that as if i no longer matter come first    i feel selfish for saying i don t want kids because i want to work    lol i can t be the only one    ladies   what do you think   is this all in my head or does the show accurately show the not so fun sides of motherhood  ,-0.9234,299

1,is choking during sex a red flag  was recently dating a guy that was crazy intense during sex  he respected my boundaries and never did anything i wasnt ok with  but he did like to choke  the first time we had sex he wrapped his forearm around my neck clavicle so hard it was sore the next day  i told him about it and he never did it that forcefully again  but still    he was open intense connected during sex in a way that i find really rare and i was starting to fall for him  but he abruptly ended things for either a picture he saw on my instagram or because i was upset he flaked on a date and he didnt like what i said when i texted him about it    thanks for blowing me off all week     i dont really understand what sexual pleasure men get out of choking  im fine with a little light pressure but i dont get whats the point of doing it so hard i have to gesture to get him to stop  i once slept with another guy who choked me so hard my eyes were fucked up after  that guy was super gentle and quiet otherwise  in this case i felt like ok i can get choking is a thing some people are into  but why is it necessary to do so hard  not sure if its related but he also liked a  daddy  dynamic during sex  kind of a general manhood ego thing i guess   the intensity of the brief relationship  the abrupt and immediate way he cut it off  and his interest in choking is    interesting to me  i also know that in domestic violence situations  one of the strongest predictors of a man killing the woman is that he choked her before  i wonder if a man into choking is in itself a red flag or if there were just a lot of other things going on with this specific guy generally  idgi   does it mean or say anything psychologically if a man likes to forcefully choke during sex  ,-0.983,351

1,advice for unusual circumstance  relationship advice  m     good evening to everyone reading this  i m using a throw away account for this post  and sorry in advance for it being long  i really appreciate the people who will take the time to read this     as i ve previously sourced from this thread  a lot of the post have to deal with relationship advice  the predicament i am in is as stated        i m currently a high schooler  and have little to no problems asking women out in public  i tend to shy away from asking out people at school because rejection when you re a teen  especially at a high school spreads like wildfire  even more so if the girl or her friends aren t the nicest of people  granted i have asked out girls at my high school  some have said yes  some have said no  things happen lol  but everyone of the girls i asked out  i somewhat knew who they were personally  only has been one exception  but that s a long story        now there is this one girl that i see around the halls every now and again  for the past year  maybe year and a half  and i ve never had the courage to go up to her  i do know who she is because some of my friends know her  and she and i follow each other on social media  non mutual obviously  but i m not personally close enough with any of them to ask them for advice  i m normally fine with asking strangers out on dates outside of school  but i feel as if high school girls tend to reject guys  if they don t know who they are before hand   which i may be wrong   what i m asking with this is    since i hope the people reading this post are women  that if you were in that girls shoes  how would you feel if a guy you never knew  and  for what i assume  have never seen before  came up  talked for a quick couple seconds  and asked you for you number  saying i d like to get to know her  i wrote some lines out to practice  since i ve kinda come to terms with my self over winter break that if i ever want anything to possibly happen with this girl that i m going to have to push through my shell and ask her out eventually  i m just looking for some advice or tips going in       anything will help  if you d like me to include the lines i wrote  and possibly give me some revisions  here they are  if not please ignore them  sorry if the title was misleading also  had to write something that people would likely click on     thanks again d               excuse me do you have a minute   say hi to her friend that she walks with during  nd  hi im d  what s your name   states her name  j  how s your morning going   good   yours   if she doesn t ask how mine is  just roll with it  that s good   mine is going well  listen i don t really do this that often  since it s kind of a cliche that i don t necessarily know you and all  but i ve seen you around here a few times before and i couldn t help but ask if i could get your number  i d like to get to know you  if you re available of course                   ,0.9913,587

1,so i tried contacting a girl i saw at a live event    as mentioned above  at a hockey game  i saw a very cute girl in a group for a sports organization  i missed any opportunities to approach her at the game  not wanting to embarrass her or myself in front of her group of friends  and sitting a few rows behind  didn t want a denial to make her feel uncomfortable for the remainder of the game  with family as well  i decided i would backtrack her through her sports team after the fact  i eventually found her entire team on a sports stats app  and proceeded to find her on ig  once again wanting to avoid any embarrassment for her  i made a fake account so that if i messaged to wrong person  presumably a teammate who would know her  and proceed to gossip with her teammates as i know from experience teams tend to do  and proceeded to message her  saying i saw her and her goofy dancing at the game  and recognizing that it was unusual to be sending her a message from a random account  said i was just doing so to ensure i was talking to the right person  i was blocked immediately  which shouldn t surprise me  i felt uncomfortable after sending a  weird  message like that in the first place anyways  and knew i shouldn t have really expected any kind of interest  much less a response   so my question to the women of reddit is this  should i pursue this   i e  message from main account apologizing for being so weird about it  or should i accept that i basically burned a bridge by not taking the risk in the first place  and move on with my life since i ll likely always be viewed as a creep by her regardless of approach    one last note  i don t want people to think i m some kind of stalker or something  i ve just passed up on so many opportunities before  and she was so breathtaking  that i didn t know what else i could possibly due since i missed my chance in person  tl dr  i saw a cute girl at a sports event who was affiliated with a sports team  missed a chance to talk to her live  so proceeded to find her through her organization and message her on ig through a fake account to avoid  backlash  if i messaged the wrong person  and was blocked immediately  now debating if i should bother pursuing this girl  in the most non creepy way of course  ,0.1128,436
